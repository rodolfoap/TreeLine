TreeLine Installation Notes

Extract the source files from the treeline tar file, then change to the
'TreeLine' directory in a terminal.  For a basic installation, simply
execute the following command as root:  'python install.py'

To see all install options, use: 'python install.py -h'

To install TreeLine with a different prefix (the default is
'/usr/local'), use:  'python install.py -p /prefix/path'

The old '~/.treeline' configuration file should be deleted or renamed if
this is a major TreeLine upgrade (such as 0.5.x to 0.6.x) or if editing
of new keyboard shortcuts is planned.

To install language translations for TreeLine, download the
"treeline-i18n-..." tar file that matches the version number of the main
TreeLine file (ignore the letter suffix on the translation version
number). To install the program and translation files simultaneously,
extract the translation file from the same directory where the main
treeline tar file was extracted and run the install command as described
above. If TreeLine is already installed, extract the translation file to
any directory and run the translation's install command as described
above.
