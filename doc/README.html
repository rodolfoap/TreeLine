        <h2>Background</h2>

        <div>
          <p>Do you have lots of sticky notes lying around with various
          useful information jotted down? Or many lists of books, movies,
          links, website logins, personal contacts, or things to do? Can you
          find them when you need them? Well, I often couldn't. So here's my
          answer.</p>

          <p>Some would call TreeLine an Outliner, others would call it a
          PIM. Basically, it just stores almost any kind of information. A
          tree structure makes it easy to keep things organized. And each
          node in the tree can contain several fields, forming a
          mini-database. The output format for each node can be defined, and
          the output can be shown on the screen, printed, or exported to
          HTML.</p>

          <p>Since I'm not in the software business, I'm making this program
          free for anyone to use, distribute and modify, as long as it is not
          incorporated into any proprietary programs. If you like the
          software, feel free to let others know about it. And let me know
          what you think - see the <a href="#contact">Questions, Comments,
          Criticisms?</a> section for contact information.</p>

        <h2>Features</h2>

        <div>
          <h4>General</h4>

          <div>
            <ul>
              <li>Stores almost any type of information, including plain
              text, HTML, numbers, dates, times, booleans, URLs, etc.</li>

              <li>The tree structure helps keep things organized.</li>

              <li>Each node can have several fields that form a
              mini-database.</li>

              <li>Several node types, with different sets of fields, can be
              included in one file.</li>

              <li>The node format, including fields, output lines and
              tree-view icon, can be defined for each node type.</li>
            </ul>
          </div>

          <h4>Views</h4>

          <div>
            <ul>
              <li>The left-hand view defaults to a tree view but can show a
              flat list of descendants of the current node.</li>

              <li>The left flat view also shows the results of filtering
              operations.</li>

              <li>The right-hand view can show one of three views - for
              showing output, editing node data and editing node titles.</li>

              <li>The right-hand view is normally split to show data from the
              parent node and its children.</li>

              <li>If multiple nodes are selected, the right-hand view shows
              all of their data.</li>

              <li>The output view can be set to show indented output from all
              descendant nodes.</li>
            </ul>
          </div>

          <h4>Navigation</h4>

          <div>
            <ul>
              <li>There is a quick incremental search command to find a
              matching node title.</li>

              <li>There is a find command that searches through all node
              data.</li>

              <li>Previous and next selection commands toggle selections to
              quickly move between parts of the tree.</li>
            </ul>
          </div>

          <h4>Formatting</h4>

          <div>
            <ul>
              <li>The dialog for data type configuration has several tabs to
              easily set all type, field and output parameters.</li>

              <li>Formatting information can be copied from another TreeLine
              file.</li>
            </ul>
          </div>

          <h4>File Handling</h4>

          <div>
            <ul>
              <li>Undo and redo commands are available for all modifying
              operations.</li>

              <li>TreeLine files are XML by default, but there are options
              for automatically compressing or encrypting the files.</li>

              <li>Document templates for new files are preformatted to cover
              basic needs.</li>

              <li>The formatted output can be printed with parent/child lines
              and headers and footers.</li>
            </ul>
          </div>

          <h4>File Import and Export</h4>

          <div>
            <ul>
              <li>The data can be exported to HTML.</li>

              <li>An XSLT file can be exported to work with the XML TreeLine
              files.</li>

              <li>Tab-delimited tables and tab-indented text files can be
              imported and exported. Plain text files and Treepad files can
              be imported.</li>

              <li>Mozilla and XBEL format bookmark files can be imported and
              exported.</li>

              <li>Generic XML files can be imported and exported, allowing
              TreeLine to function as a crude XML editor.</li>

              <li>ODF text documents can be imported and exported as
              outlines.</li>

              <li>Batch file conversions can be done from a command line
              interface.</li>
            </ul>
          </div>

          <h4>Linking Objects</h4>

          <div>
            <ul>
              <li>Clicking on URL fields in the output view opens the link in
              an external web browser.</li>

              <li>There are internal link fields that select another node
              based on a reference or a keyword.</li>

              <li>An executable link can run an external program or open a
              file when clicked.</li>
            </ul>
          </div>

          <h4>Data Manipulation</h4>

          <div>
            <ul>
              <li>There are several sorting options.</li>

              <li>The nodes can be filtered.</li>

              <li>A node's icon and output format can be changed
              conditionally based on its data.</li>

              <li>Text data can be spell checked (requires an external
              program - see the <a href="#sysreq">System Requirements</a>
              section).</li>

              <li>Data can be automatically arranged using either parent
              references or categories from data fields.</li>

              <li>There is an outline numbering feature.</li>
            </ul>
          </div>

          <h4>Customization</h4>

          <div>
            <ul>
              <li>There are many options for customizing both general and
              file-based attributes.</li>

              <li>There are editors for keyboard shortcuts and toolbar
              commands.</li>

          <h4>Linux</h4>

          <div>
            <p>TreeLine requires the following libraries and programs:</p>

            <div>
              <ul>
                <li>Qt (Version 4.4 or higher)</li>

                for more information)</li>

                <li>An XML parser is required, such as the expat library or
                the PyXML package</li>

                <li>If spell checking capability is desired, either the
                aspell (preferred) or ispell programs are required (these are
                packaged with most distributions)</li>
              </ul>
            </div>
          </div><a id="win-sys" name="win-sys">

          <h4>Windows</h4>

          <div>
            <p>Using the files provided in the installer, TreeLine should run
            on any computer running Windows XP, Vista or 7.</p>

            <p>If spell checking capability is desired, an external program
            is required. Either aspell (preferred) or ispell must be
            installed. See <a href=
            "http://aspell.net/win32/">aspell.net/win32/</a> or <a href=
            "http://www.luziusschneider.com/Speller/English/">www.luziusschneider.com/Speller/English/</a>
            to download one of the programs and its dictionaries for any
            desired languages.</p>
          </div>
        </div><a id="install" name="install">
        <hr>

        <h2>Installation</h2>

        <div>
          <a id="linux-inst" name="linux-inst">

          <h4>Linux</h4>

          <div>
            <p>Extract the source files from the treeline tar file, then
            change to the TreeLine directory in a terminal. For a basic
            installation, simply execute the following command as root:
            "python install.py"</p>

            <p>To see all install options, use: "python install.py -h"<br>
            <br>
            To install TreeLine with a different prefix (the default is
            /usr/local), use: "python install.py -p /prefix/path"</p>

            <p>To install language translations for TreeLine, download the
            "treeline-i18n-..." tar file that matches the version number of
            the main TreeLine file (ignore the letter suffix on the
            translation version number). To install the program and
            translation files simultaneously, extract the translation file
            from the same directory where the main treeline tar file was
            extracted and run the install command as described above. If
            TreeLine is already installed, extract the translation file to
            any directory and run the translation's install command as
            described above.</p>
          </div><a id="win-inst" name="win-inst">

          <h4>Windows</h4>

          <div>
            <p>Simply execute the downloaded installation file
            (treeline-x.x.x-install.exe). It will install the program with
            its libraries and optionally create file associations and
            shortcuts.</p>

            <p>To use TreeLine's spell checker, an external program (aspell
            or ispell) must be installed (see the <a href="#sysreq">System
            Requirements</a> section).</p>

            <p>To install language translations for TreeLine, download the
            "treeline-i18n-..." exe file that matches the version number of
            the main TreeLine file (ignore the letter suffix on the
            translation version number). To install the translation files,
            simply execute the translation file.</p>

            <p>If you wish to modify the source code or write your own PyQt
            programs for Windows, do not use the above procedure. Instead,
            you need to install Python (see <a href=
            "http://www.python.org">www.python.org</a>), Qt (see <a href=
            "http://www.trolltech.com">www.trolltech.com</a>), and PyQt (see
            <a href=
            "http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk">www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk</a>).
            Then extract the source code files from the Linux version
            (treeline tar file) to a directory of your choice and execute the
            treeline.py file.</p>

          <h3>Getting Started</h3>

          <div>
            <a id="start-intro" name="start-intro">

            <h4>Introduction</h4>

            <p>TreeLine is a more complex program than it appears at first
            glance. Reading much of this documentation is highly recommended
            in order to learn to use it effectively.<br>
            <br>
            The <a href="#basics">Basics</a> section describes views and
            selections. To learn how to move around and change the tree,
            refer to the <a href="#nav">Tree Navigation</a> and <a href=
            "#edit">Tree Editing</a> sections. Next, its time to go beyond
            using TreeLine with only simple text for each node. To learn
            about setting up custom data for each node, refer to the <a href=
            "#format">Formatting and Node Types</a> and the <a href=
            "#fields">Field Types</a> sections.</p><a id="start-templates"
            name="start-templates">

            <h4>Templates</h4>

            <p>When starting a new file, the templates dialog gives a choice
            of nodes with a single line of text or with long text. The single
            line template only has a node title, while the long text options
            have a title and a multiple line text field in each node. For
            long text, you can also choose between plain text, which
            preserves line breaks, and HTML text, which allows more complex
            formatting.<br>
            <br>
            There are a few more specific options, including canned setups
            for personal contact information, a book list and a to-do
            list.</p><a id="start-example" name="start-example">

            <h4>Example Files</h4>

            <p>Various TreeLine sample files can be opened by using the
            "File-&gt;Open Sample" command. They include (roughly in order of
            increasing complexity):</p>

            <div>
              <ul>
                <li>The "sample_basic_contacts" file is a format for storing
                contact information. Several fields are used for various
                pieces of information.</li>

                <li>The "sample_basic_booklist" file is a list of books,
                providing an example of configuring nodes to contain data.
                Several different field types are used to create author and
                book data types.</li>

                <li>The "sample_basic_longtext" file contains a long text
                field under each node, similar to the Treepad program. It
                also shows the difference between plain text and HTML text
                fields.</li>

                <li>The "sample_color_items" file uses HTML tags in data type
                formats to provide color output. See also the <a href=
                "#format-html">HTML Tags</a> section.</li>

                <li>The "sample_char_format" file is an example of using HTML
                tags in the data to control font formatting. See also the
                <a href="#format-html">HTML Tags</a> and the <a href=
                "#field-options">Field Options</a> sections.</li>

                <li>The "sample_bookmarks" file is an example of using
                external HTML links. This is the file setup that is used when
                importing or exporting bookmark files.</li>

                <li>The "sample_intern_links" file shows how to do links that
                lead to elsewhere in the TreeLine file. See also the <a href=
                "#field-link">Linking Types</a> section.</li>

                <li>The "sample_table_booklist" file shows how to use HTML
                tags and sibling prefixes and suffixes to create tables in
                the output. See also the <a href="#format-advanced">Advanced
                Settings</a> section.</li>

                <li>The "sample_other_fields" file is an example of alternate
                field references, including references to ancestor nodes,
                child nodes and file information. See also the <a href=
                "#format-refs">Other Field References</a> section.</li>

                <li>The "sample_conditional_todo" shows how to use
                conditional types to change node output based on node
                content. See also the <a href="#format-derived">Derived</a>
                and <a href="#format-condition">Conditional Types</a>
                sections.</li>

                <li>The "readme" file itself shows many types of formatting,
                including headings, bullets, internal links and
                pictures.</li>
              </ul>
            </div>
          </div><a id="basics" name="basics">
          <hr>

          <h3>Basics</h3>

          <div>
            <a id="basics-left" name="basics-left">

            <h4>Left Pane Views</h4>

            <p>The default view in the left pane is the "Tree View". Parent
            nodes can be opened and closed to display or hide their indented
            descendant nodes.<br>
            <br>
            The other tab in the left pane is the "Flat View". It displays
            all of the descendants of the nodes that are selected in the
            "Tree View" in a flat list. It also shows the results of
            filtering operations (see the <a href=
            "#data-filter">Filtering</a> section).</p><a id="basics-right"
            name="basics-right">

            <h4>Right Pane Views</h4>

            <p>The right pane is tabbed to show one of three different views
            of the data. The "Data Output" view shows the formatted text for
            each node and is read-only (see <a href="#fig-1">Figure 1</a>).
            The "Data Editor" view shows a text edit box for each data field
            within a node (see <a href="#fig-2">Figure 2</a>). The "Title
            List" view shows a list of node titles that can be modified using
            typical text editor methods.<br>
            <br>
            When a parent node is selected in the tree, the right view will
            default to showing information about the selected node in an
            upper pane and information about the selected node's children in
            the lower pane. The "View-&gt;Show Child Pane" command will
            toggle the display of the child nodes. If the selected node has
            no children, the view will show a single pane with information
            about the selected node only.<br>
            <br>
            When multiple nodes are selected in the tree, the right view will
            not display any child node information. It will instead show
            information about every selected node.<br>
            <br>
            When the "View-&gt;Show Output Descendants" command is toggled,
            the "Data Output" tab will show an indented list with information
            about every descendant of a single selected node.<br>
            <br>
            The initial state of the views can be controlled by changing the
            startup conditions in "Tools-&gt;General Options".<br>
            <br>
            By default, the number of nodes displayed simultaneously in the
            "Data Editor" view is limited. Buttons in a heading allow the
            next or previous set of nodes to be displayed. This provides a
            convenient way to page through the node information without
            slowing the program by trying to display too many fields. The
            number of pages to display can be set in "Tools-&gt;General
            Options".</p>

            <div>
              <a id="fig-1" name="fig-1">

            </div><a id="basics-cmds" name="basics-cmds">

            <h4>Commands</h4>

            <p>Most of the menu and tool-bar commands apply to the items
            selected in the left view. In general, they perform an operation
            on the nodes themselves or on the descendants of the nodes.
            Multiple nodes can be selected by holding down the "Ctrl" and
            "Shift" buttons when clicking with the mouse.<br>
            <br>
            To add information to a new TreeLine document, use the
            "Edit-&gt;Add Child" command to create a new node. Then
            combinations of the add and insert commands may be used for
            additional nodes. Alternatively, new node titles may be typed
            into the "Title List" view in the right pane.</p><a id=
            "basics-wins" name="basics-wins">

            <h4>Multiple Windows</h4>

            <p>Multiple TreeLine windows with different files can be opened
            within the same TreeLine session. The "Open files in new windows"
            option in "Tools-&gt;General Options" controls whether new
            windows are used when opening or creating files.<br>
            <br>
            The "Window-&gt;New Window" command will create a new window with
            views of the same TreeLine file. Changes in either window are
            saved in the same document. This can be used to work in different
            sections of the file simultaneously. For performance reasons, the
            non-active window does not show the changes made in the active
            window until either the non-active window is focused or the
            "Window-&gt;Update Other Window" command is issued.<br>
            <br>
            Starting TreeLine (from a shortcut, file association or command
            line) will activate an existing TreeLine session if it is already
            running. A new window will be opened if an unopened file was
            specified by file association or in the command line.</p>
          </div><a id="nav" name="nav">

          <h3>Tree Navigation</h3>

          <div>
            <a id="nav-keys" name="nav-keys">

            <h4>Keyboard Shortcuts</h4>

            <p>There are several keyboard commands that can be used for tree
            navigation. The up and down arrow keys move the selection. The
            left and right arrows open and close the current node. Holding
            the CTRL and SHIFT keys with "J" or "K" moves between siblings,
            skipping children. The CTRL key and "U" moves to an item's
            parent. The "Home", "End", "Page Up" and "Page Down" keys can be
            used to move quickly through the tree. The CTRL and SHIFT keys
            can be held with the "Page Up" and "Page Down" keys to move the
            tree view even when a different pane is focused.<br>
            <br>
            All of these keys and the keyboard shortcuts for pull-down menu
            commands can be customized by using the "Tools-&gt;Set Keyboard
            Shortcuts" command. The shortcut editor has tabs for menu and
            non-menu based commands. Simply type the new key sequence with
            the appropriate field selected.<br>
            <br>
            Another way to move through the tree is to type the first letter
            of a visible node title. Hitting the letter again moves to the
            next possibility.</p><a id="nav-select" name="nav-select">

            <h4>Selection</h4>

            <p>Multiple nodes can be selected by holding down the CTRL or the
            SHIFT keys when changing the active node. Individual nodes are
            added or removed from the selection when the CTRL key is held.
            The selection of all nodes between the old and new active nodes
            are toggled when SHIFT is held. The active node can be changed by
            using the mouse or by using any of the keyboard navigation
            methods.<br>
            <br>
            The "View-&gt;Previous Selection" and "View-&gt;Next Selection"
            commands can be used to toggle through a history of selections,
            allowing faster navigation through the tree.<br>
            <br>
            By default, the selection sequence doesn't matter. However, if
            the general option for multiple selection is changed to
            "Selection Order", nodes selected with CTRL key held are output
            in the order selected.</p><a id="nav-search" name="nav-search">

            <h4>Searching</h4>

            <p>There are two ways to search for nodes. These methods can find
            nodes that are buried in the tree structure. The first is the
            "Tools-&gt;Find" command. Keywords can be entered in a modeless
            dialog box. A node is found if the keywords are matched in any of
            the node's fields. The matching text will highlight in the "Data
            Output" pane.<br>
            <br>
            The next method is an incremental search, started by typing CTRL
            + "/". Then type the search string, which shows up in the lower
            status bar area. The search will progress as the string is being
            typed. The incremental search only finds text in the node's
            titles. The previous search can be repeated with the "F3" key and
            backward with "Shift-F3".<br>
            <br>
            By default, parent nodes will automatically open and close when
            found with the search methods, by typing the first letter, and
            with the "next sibling" keyboard command. This behavior can be
            disabled in "Tools-&gt;General Options".</p>

          <h3>Tree Editing</h3>

          <div>
            <a id="edit-menu" name="edit-menu">

            <h4>Edit Menu</h4>

            <p>The commands in the "Edit" menu (except for undo and redo)
            operate on the selected nodes in the left tree view. The cut,
            copy and paste commands can be an exception to this, since they
            operate on the right view when something is selected there. And
            keep in mind that, in general, the descendants of the selected
            nodes are also affected.<br>
            <br>
            Paste will add a copied nodes as the last child of the selected
            node. If more than one node is selected, additional copies are
            added under each selected node.<br>
            <br>
            The "Edit-&gt;Paste Node Text" command renames the selection
            based on either the text in the clipboard or the title of the top
            node in the clipboard.</p><a id="edit-shortcuts" name=
            "edit-shortcuts">

            <h4>Shortcuts</h4>

            <p>There are several shortcuts for use in tree editing. Drag and
            drop will move or copy nodes to become a children of the
            destination node. Clicking on a selected node will rename it.
            Pressing the enter key will insert a new node, and pressing the
            delete key will remove the selected nodes. If desired, these
            shortcuts can be disabled in "Tools-&gt;General
            Options".</p><a id="edit-view" name="edit-view">

            <h4>Right Pane Views</h4>

            <p>In the right pane, the "Data Editor" view provides the most
            direct way to edit the data within a node. If the edited field is
            used in the title formatting, the node title in the tree will
            show the changes. The field editor will scroll, allowing multiple
            lines of text to be entered.<br>
            <br>
            There are items in the "Data Editor" box context menus to add
            HTML font tags around selected text. These tags include bold,
            italics, underline, size and color. Note that the fields must be
            set to display HTML content (see the <a href="#fields">Field
            Types</a> section) for this to be effective.<br>
            <br>
            Another edit box context menu item will add an internal link in
            the text. The status bar will then prompt the user to click on
            the link destination in the tree view. This will add an internal
            link to that destination to the text in the edit box. Of course,
            the field must be set to display HTML content for this to be
            effective.<br>
            <br>
            An external editor can also be invoked from a "Data Editor" box
            context menu. After the text editor saves changes and is closed,
            the changed text will be in the text box. The EDITOR environment
            variable can be used to specify the editor to start, or, if the
            variable doesn't exist, TreeLine will prompt for an executable to
            set as the default.<br>
            <br>
            Also in the right pane, the "Title List" view is useful to
            quickly rename child titles or to add new child nodes. A text
            list of new nodes can even be pasted directly into this
            view.</p><a id="edit-spell" name="edit-spell">

            <h4>Spell Check</h4>

            <p>There is a spell check command in the "Tools" menu. Use of
            this command requires an external program to be installed (either
            aspell or ispell - see the <a href="#sysreq">System
            Requirements</a> section). If there are any misspelled words in
            the selected branch, a dialog will allow the word to be ignored,
            added to the dictionary, replaced with a suggestion or edited.
            This will spell check the text in all data fields of each
            node.<br>
            <br>
            By default, the spell check will use dictionaries for the current
            operating system language. If using aspell, there is an option
            under "Tools-&gt;File Options" to specify an alternate two-letter
            language code for the current TreeLine file. Note that the
            appropriate aspell dictionary files must be installed and that
            this option does not work with ispell.</p>

          <h3>Formatting and Node Types</h3>

          <div>
            <a id="format-set" name="format-set">

            <h4>Setting Nodes to a Type</h4>

            <p>By default, a new TreeLine document contains two node types:
            "ROOT" and "DEFAULT". The type is shown at the top of each node
            box in the "Data Editor" right-hand view. The creation of new
            types and the customization of types is described below. To set
            the selected nodes to a specific type, use the "Data-&gt;Set Item
            Type" menu. Alternately, to set a series of child and descendant
            nodes to a specific type, use the "Data-&gt;Set Descendant Types"
            command. The resulting dialog box allows the selected nodes,
            their children, all descendants, or descendants matching logical
            conditions to be set to the highlighted type. The dialog box can
            be left open while the tree selection is changed to set more
            nodes.</p><a id="format-type" name="format-type">

            <h4>Type List</h4>

            <p>The "Type List" is the first tab of the "Data-&gt;Configure
            Types Dialog". The list of data types can be modified by the
            buttons on the right. New types can be added, and existing types
            can be copied, renamed or deleted.</p><a id="format-config" name=
            "format-config">

            <h4>Type Config</h4>

            <p>"Type Config" is the second tab of the "Data-&gt;Configure
            Types Dialog". It contains a selection for the default child
            type. If set, this will be the initial type used for new children
            with this type of parent. If set to "[None]", children will
            default to either the type of their siblings or their parent.<br>
            <br>
            The "Change Icon" button allows the selection of a custom tree
            icon for this data type. The "Clear Select" button on the icon
            dialog can be used to set the icon to "None", so that no icon
            will be displayed for this type. To avoid showing any tree icons,
            the "Show icons in the tree view" general option can be
            unset.</p><a id="format-fields" name="format-fields">

            <h4>Field List</h4>

            <p>The "Field List" is the third tab of the "Data-&gt;Configure

            modified by using the buttons on the right. New fields can be
            added, and existing fields can be moved up and down in the list,
            renamed or deleted.</p><a id="format-fieldconf" name=
            "format-fieldconf">

            <h4>Field Config</h4>

            <p>"Field Config" is the fourth tab of the "Data-&gt;Configure

            and its output format string can be set (see the <a href=
            "#fields">Field Types</a> section for details). Extra prefix and
            suffix text to be output with the field can also be set, and a
            default field value for new nodes can be entered. There is a
            choice between plain text, which preserves line breaks, and HTML
            text, which allows various formatting options. Finally, the
            number of lines displayed in the editor for the field can be
            specified.</p>

            dialog shows the fields. The right half shows the formatting for
            the title (used for the node text in the tree view) and the node
            output. The formatting consists of text lines with embedded
            fields. The fields are shown as "{*field_name*}". The field that
            is selected in the list can be added to a format at the cursor
            position with the "&gt;&gt;" keys. The format field reference at
            the cursor can be removed with the "&lt;&lt;" keys.</p>

            <h4>Title Formatting</h4>

            <p>When a node in the tree is renamed, the program attempts to
            match the title formatting pattern to set the appropriate fields.
            If the title formatting is too complex, it may not correctly
            guess the intent. Things like adjacent fields with no characters
            separating them should be avoided unless you do not wish to
            rename nodes from the tree.<br>
            <br>
            If the text data used for a tree view title has multiple lines,
            only the first line will be used as the title.</p><a id=
            "format-skip" name="format-skip">

            <h4>Skipped Output Lines</h4>

            <p>If a line in the output formatting contains one or more fields
            and all of those fields for a given node are empty, the line is
            skipped. No blank line or embedded text will be output for that
            line. Note that this does not apply to a line without any fields
            (only embedded text). Also, when a line ending with a &lt;br/&gt;
            or an &lt;hr/&gt; tag is skipped, the ending tag is
            retained.</p><a id="format-html" name="format-html">

            <h4>HTML Tags</h4>

            <p>Simple HTML formatting tags can be used in node output
            formats. Commonly used tags include "&lt;b&gt;bold&lt;/b&gt;",
            "&lt;u&gt;underline&lt;/u&gt;", "line break&lt;br/&gt;",
            "&lt;hr/&gt;horizontal line", and various font tags. Complex
            block tags should generally be avoided. When the "Allow HTML rich
            text in formats" file option is disabled, formatting tags are
            treated as plain text. For an example of tag use, see the
            "sample_color_items" file (by using the "File-&gt;Open Sample"
            command).<br>
            <br>
            A line break is automatically output after each formatting line,
            unless the "Add line breaks after each line" file option is
            unset. In addition, the "Add blank lines between nodes" file
            option determines whether there is also an automatic blank line
            between node outputs. A line break tag ("&lt;br&gt;") can be used
            at the end of the formatting to get the same effect, or a
            horizontal line tag ("&lt;hr&gt;") may be used instead to
            separate the nodes.</p><a id="format-example" name=
            "format-example">

            <h4>Formatting Examples</h4>

            <p>Here is an example of output formatting for a book list:<br>
            <br>
            &lt;hr/&gt;"{*Title*}"<br>
            (c) {*Copyright*}, Rating: {*Rating*}<br>
            {*PlotDescription*}<br>
            <br>
            Sample files with various kinds of formatting are included in the
            program distribution. They can be opened by using the
            "File-&gt;Open Sample" command. They are also listed in the
            <a href="#start-example">Example Files</a> section.</p><a id=
            "format-refs" name="format-refs">

            <h4>Other Field References</h4>

            <p>References to fields that are not contained within the node
            can be added to the output. Pushing the "Show Advanced" button on
            the "Output" tab of the configure dialog makes a reference level
            selection become visible.<br>
            <br>
            If the reference level is changed to "File Info Reference",
            fields containing file meta-data can be added to the output.
            These include the file name, path, size, and modified time. These
            are shown as "{*!field_name*}" in the title and output format
            editors.<br>
            <br>
            There are field references to various ancestor nodes (parents,
            grandparents, etc.). These require the data type of the reference
            to be specified. This selection determines the field names that
            are available, but the data from any type with a matching field
            name will be shown in the output. References to fields from
            parent and grandparent nodes are shown as "{**field_name*}" and
            "{***field_name*}", respectively. There are also general ancestor
            references, shown as "{*?field_name*}", that take data from the
            closest ancestor with a matching field.<br>
            <br>
            References to child nodes can also be added. These also require
            that the child data type be specified. The child data becomes
            embedded in the parent output. The child data is delimited with a
            separator string defined as a file option. The separator defaults
            to a comma and a space, but can be set to &lt;br&gt; or anything
            else.<br>
            <br>
            Finally, a "Child Count" reference can be added. This field will
            show the number of children ("Level1" field) or grandchildren
            ("Level2" field) of a node. These are shown as {*#Level1*} in the
            format editors.<br>
            <br>
            For examples of these fields, see the "sample_other_fields" file
            (by using the "File-&gt;Open Sample" command).</p><a id=
            "format-sibling-text" name="format-sibling-text">

            <h4>Sibling Prefix and Suffix</h4>

            <p>Pushing the "Show Advanced" button on the "Type Config" tab of
            the configure dialog makes a sibling text section become visible,
            with settings for sibling prefix and suffix tags. These tags can
            often be left blank, but are useful for creating tables or
            bulleted lists. These tags will be placed before and after
            sibling groups of the proper type. For example, to create an
            output table, the sibling prefix tag could be set to "&lt;table
            border="1"&gt;" and the suffix tag could be set to
            "&lt;/table&gt;". Then, the output format could be set to:<br>
            <br>
            &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;"{*Title*}"&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;(c)
            {*Copyright*}&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;<br>
            <br>
            Also see the "sample_table_booklist" example file (by using the
            "File-&gt;Open Sample" command).<br>
            <br>
            Siblings should generally be of the same type, or at least have
            the same prefix and suffix tags.</p><a id="format-link-ref" name=
            "format-link-ref">

            <h4>Link Reference Field</h4>

            <p>One of the fields for each type is designated as the link
            reference field. By default, it is the first field in the list.
            Pushing the "Show Advanced" button on the "Type Config" tab of
            the configure dialog shows the selector for this field.<br>
            <br>
            The link reference field is used for internal link references and
            for the arrange and flatten by reference commands. The contents
            of this field should generally be unique if usage of these
            functions is planned.</p><a id="format-derived" name=
            "format-derived">

            <h4>Generic and Derived Types</h4>

            <p>Data types can be set to derive their field settings from a
            generic type. This allows types with different output formatting
            to always use the same set of fields. Any changes to the
            generic's list of fields and field types are automatically
            reflected in the fields of all derived types. This does not apply
            to a field's output formatting, which can still be set
            independently.<br>
            <br>
            There are two methods for creating derived types. First, a
            derived option can be selected when copying a type on the "Type
            List" tab of the "Data-&gt;Configure Types Dialog". Alternately,
            a generic type can be specified from the derived type's "Type
            Config" tab of the dialog if the advanced functions are
            shown.</p><a id="format-condition" name="format-condition">

            <h4>Conditional Types</h4>

            <p>Conditional expressions can be used to automatically assign a
            data type based on each node's content. Conditions can be
            assigned only to a generic type and its associated derived types.
            This allows the automatic assignment of different output
            formatting or different icons depending on each node's field
            data.<br>
            <br>
            The conditional dialog box is accessed from a button on the "Type
            Config" tab of the "Data-&gt;Configure Types Dialog" if the
            advanced functions are shown. Each line of the condition includes
            a field, an operator and a comparison value (see <a href=
            "#fig-5">Figure 5</a>). The operators include equality, greater
            than, less than, starts with, ends with, and contains. There are
            also True and False operators that will toggle the type of all
            nodes simultaneously.<br>
            <br>
            For special field types such as dates, times, and booleans, the
            comparison value should be entered in the same format that is
            used in the Data Editor window. In general, the starts with, ends
            with, and contains operators should not be used for these special
            fields, since the comparison is done using an internal data
            representation. Dates and times also support a special comparison
            value of "now", which is always interpreted as the current date
            and time.<br>
            <br>
            The "Add New Rule" button is used to add additional condition
            lines. The lines can be joined with "and" or "or" operators. The
            "Remove Rule" button deletes the last condition line. If only a
            single line is present, the "Remove Rule" button completely
            removes the condition.<br>
            <br>
            Conditions do not have to be set for all types in a family. If no
            conditions are true for a node, the program will select a blank
            condition over a false one.<br>
            <br>
            For an example, see the "sample_conditional_todo" file (by using
            the "File-&gt;Open Sample" command).</p>

            <h4>Copying Formats</h4>

            <p>Another method for changing data type formatting is to copy
            the formats from another TreeLine file. This is done with the
            "Data-&gt;Copy Types from File" command. All types from the
            chosen file are copied. Any types in the current file with
            matching names are overwritten, but types with unique names are
            retained.</p>

          <h3>Field Types</h3>

          <div>
            <a id="field-options" name="field-options">

            <h4>Field Options</h4>

            <p>The field type and options are set in the "Field Config" tab
            of the "Data-&gt;Configure Types Dialog" (see <a href=
            "#fig-3">Figure 3</a>). The field type may be set to text,
            number, choice, combination, auto choice, date, time, boolean,
            URL, path, internal link, executable link, unique ID, email, or
            picture. Prefix and suffix text can be entered and will show up
            whenever the data is not blank.<br>
            <br>
            There are also settings for text content handling that can be set
            to allow HTML rich text in the field data or to preserve line
            breaks (ignoring HTML code). If HTML rich text is used, carriage
            returns are ignored and non-escaped "&lt;", "&gt;" and "&amp;"
            symbols do not display. There is also a general option available
            that makes new fields default to HTML content. For an example of
            rich text use, see the "sample_char_format" file (by using the
            "File-&gt;Open Sample" command).<br>
            <br>
            Several of the field types use a formatting string to define
            their output. For a list of available formatting characters, use
            the "Format Help" button. Entries in the data editor which do not
            match the format will cause the field name label to show in bold,
            and the output for that field will be replaced by
            "#####".</p><a id="field-text" name="field-text">

            <h4>Text Type</h4>

            <p>The default field type is a text field. These fields are
            edited using edit boxes in the data editor view. The edit box
            height expands when redisplayed after adding several lines of
            text. The edit box height can also be set explicitly in the
            "Field Config" tab.</p><a id="field-choice" name="field-choice">

            <h4>Choice, Combination and Boolean Types</h4>

            <p>The choice and combination field types allow for the selection
            of text items from a pull-down edit list. The formatting strings
            for these types list the items separated with the "/" character
            (use "//" to get a literal "/" in an item). Choice is used to
            select a single item and combination to select multiple items.
            The pull-down edit list for combination allows items to be added
            or removed. Also, the initial text of an item can be typed and
            auto-completed.<br>
            <br>
            The boolean field type is similar to choice, but defaults to
            options such as "True/False", "yes/no" and "1/0".<br>
            <br>
            There is also an AutoChoice field type. Like Choice, it provides
            pull-down selection items, but it does not have a formatting
            string. The pull-down is automatically populated with all
            previously used entries.</p><a id="field-number" name=
            "field-number">

            <h4>Number Type</h4>

            <p>In the number type, special characters in the format define
            the display of the numbers. The format uses a string of "#"
            (optional digit) and "0" (required digit) characters to define
            the output formatting. For example, pi formatted with "#.#" is
            "3.1" and formatted with "00.00" is "03.14". Regardless of the
            formatting, digits to the left of the decimal point are not
            truncated, since that would display an incorrect result. But use
            care to show enough decimal places (either optional or required)
            to avoid problems with round-off error.<br>
            <br>
            The radix character can be specified as either "." or "," to
            handle internationalization. For use as a thousands separator,
            use "\," or "\.". For example, a large number may be formatted as
            "#\,###\,###.##" or as "#\.###\.###,##". Press the "Format Help"
            button from the field format dialog for more formatting
            details.<br>
            <br>
            Unlike most other formats, the number type also uses the output
            format for display in the Data Editor. Of course, any new entry
            with a reasonable format is correctly interpreted (but the
            correct radix character must be used).</p><a id="field-date"
            name="field-date">

            <h4>Date and Time Types</h4>

            <p>In the date, and time field types, special characters in the
            formats are replaced by elements of the data, similar to number
            fields. Press the "Format Help" button from the field format
            dialog for formatting details.<br>
            <br>
            There are also formats for these types under "Tools-&gt;General
            Options-&gt;Data Editor Formats". These control how these fields
            are displayed in the Data Editor view. Generally, entries in the
            data editor with various formats will be correctly interpreted
            regardless of this setting, but dates must use the correct
            day-month-year sequence. Also note that the date editor format
            does not support days of the week. Entries which cannot be
            interpreted will cause the field name to show in bold.<br>
            <br>
            A default initial field value of "Now" can be used to get a
            time-stamp of node creation.</p><a id="field-link" name=
            "field-link">

            <h4>Linking Types</h4>

            <p>The URL, path, and email field types are used to create links
            in the output. URL is for a standard web link (defaults to
            http:// unless otherwise specified), path is for a local file
            link (defaults to file:///), and email is for a mail link
            (defaults to mailto:). When clicked in the output window. these
            links open an external browser or email program. In exported
            HTML, they act as regular links. Simply enter the desired full
            path (such as "www.bellz.org/treeline/index.html") in the data
            editor. In Linux, setting the "BROWSER" environment variable to a
            string like "mozilla %s" will result in the desired browser being
            used.<br>
            <br>
            There is also an internal link field type. It creates a clickable
            link in the Data Output window that selects the next node with
            matching text in its reference field. If link or reference fields
            contain multiple lines, each line is treated as a separate link
            or reference, respectively. If desired, the same field can be
            used as both the link and reference fields, so that clicking on a
            keyword in one node's field selects the next node that also has
            that keyword. If exported to HTML, the internal links function as
            links to page anchors, but, in cases with duplicate references,
            they only find the uppermost reference on the page instead of the
            next one. For an example, see the "sample_intern_links" file (by
            using the "File-&gt;Open Sample" command).<br>
            <br>
            The ExecuteLink field type runs an external program when its link
            is clicked. The command to run is given by the text of the field.
            Or the field's prefix may contain the program name, so that the
            field's text is used for arguments or file names. A general
            option can disable these links when security is a concern.<br>
            <br>
            The picture field type will show a referenced picture in the
            output. Enter the path to a local image file in the data editor.
            Supported image types include JPEG and PNG. GIF is support is
            optional - it may be supported depending on build options in the
            Qt library. Of course, when exporting HTML, the picture will show
            as long as the browser supports the format.</p><a id=
            "field-unique" name="field-unique">

            <h4>Unique ID Type</h4>

            <p>A Unique ID field type is automatically loaded with unique
            numbers. This is often useful for ensuring that the link
            reference field is always unique.<br>
            <br>
            Initially, the field's format string is set to the desired first
            number in the series, with optional leading zeros and optional
            leading or trailing characters. The initial number and the extra
            characters are useful to avoid duplication of numbers in
            different files. All nodes of the data type will get an
            automatically assigned ID. The field format string will always
            show the next available number, which will be given to the next
            new node of that type.</p><a id="field-advanced" name=
            "field-advanced">

            <h4>Advanced Options</h4>

            <p>The "Show Advanced" button in the "Field Config" tab of the
            "Data-&gt;Configure Types Dialog" brings up additional
            settings.<br>
            <br>
            Link fields can display alternate text in place of the target
            URL. This is done by specifying an alternate text field.<br>
            <br>
            There is also a setting to flag fields as required to be filled
            in. Those fields will be marked with an asterisk in the data edit
            view.<br>
            <br>
            Fields can also be set as hidden, to prevent them from showing in
            the data edit view.</p>

          <h3>Tree Data Manipulation</h3>

          <div>
            <a id="data-category" name="data-category">

            <h4>Category-based Commands</h4>

            <p>The "Data" menu contains commands for arranging and flattening
            the data by category and by reference. These methods are used to
            automatically add and remove levels of nodes below the current
            node in the tree.<br>
            <br>
            The "Add Category Level" command allows you to select one or more
            of the fields that the child nodes have in common. These fields
            are used to create new parent nodes for the children, grouping
            them by common categories. For example, in a list of books,
            picking the "author_first_name" and "author_last_name" fields
            will result in a tree with the books under new nodes for each
            unique author.<br>
            <br>
            The "Flatten by Category" command is almost the opposite of "Add
            Category Level". It eliminates any descendant nodes with
            children, transferring their data fields to their children. It
            will rename fields instead of overwriting data with the same
            field names, but this command is most useful when the children
            and parents are different types with unique field
            names.</p><a id="data-ref" name="data-ref">

            <h4>Reference-based Commands</h4>

            <p>The "Arrange by Reference" and "Flatten by Reference" commands
            arrange data nodes by using pointers to the value of their
            parent's reference data field. These commands rely on nodes
            having unique values in the reference field, such as an ID
            number. The "Flatten by Reference" command adds a field
            containing the parent's ID to each descendant node. It then
            places all of the nodes under the selected root node. The
            "Arrange by Reference" command does the opposite, placing each
            node under the parent with the referenced ID. If there are
            multiple nodes with the same ID, the nearest node above the child
            is chosen. Any nodes with lost parents are placed directly under
            the selected root node.<br>
            <br></p><a id="data-sort" name="data-sort">

            <h4>Sorting</h4>

            <p>The "Data-&gt;Sort" command brings up the sort dialog. It
            contains options for sorting the entire tree, the selected
            branches, the selection's children or the selection's siblings.
            The sorting can be based on specific fields within specified
            types or on titles only.<br>
            <br>
            Sorting by types allows the selection of several fields to be
            used as the first key, second key, etc. Multiple types can be
            selected in the list on the left. The fields that the selected
            types have in common are listed on the right. The fields to be
            used as keys are selected in order with the left mouse button and
            the direction is changed with the right mouse button.</p><a id=
            "data-filter" name="data-filter">

            <h4>Filtering</h4>

            <p>The "Data-&gt;Conditional Filter" command limits the display
            of nodes in the flat view based on user-defined rules. First, the
            type to be filtered is selected. Next, logical rules may be
            entered based on any of the type's fields (similar to <a href=
            "#fig-5">Figure 5</a>). Multiple rules can be linked by the "and"
            and "or" operators (press the "Add Rule" button). The "True" rule
            can be used to show all of the nodes of a given type. Only
            descendant nodes that match the rules will be shown in the "Flat
            View" pane. The filtering stays in effect for the "Flat View"
            pane until it is cleared using the "Data-&gt;Clear Filtering"
            command (see <a href="#fig-6">Figure 6</a>).<br>
            <br>
            The "Data-&gt;Text Filter" command works similarly, except it
            only prompts for a text search string. Only the nodes that have a
            match for that string somewhere in their field data are displayed
            in the "Flat View". Again, the filtering stays in effect for the
            "Flat View" pane until it is cleared using the "Data-&gt;Clear
            Filtering" command.</p>

            <h4>Numbering</h4>

            <p>The "Numbering" command is used to add number fields to
            descendant nodes. The number fields do not automatically update
            when the tree is modified - the "Numbering" command must be
            repeated. In the dialog, a new or existing field name is entered,
            and the root (selected) node may be included in the numbering if
            desired. One of three styles may be chosen: outline style
            restarts numbering for each group of children, section style
            appends the child's number onto the parent's number, and single
            level style numbers only the first level of children. The default
            formats can be used ("I, II..., A, B..., 1, 2..." for outlines;
            "1, 2..., 1.1, 1.2..." for sections), or custom formats may be
            specified for each level. The custom formats should contain one
            of the following characters: "1", "A", "a", "I", or "i". The
            series will continue from there (using numbers, letters or Roman
            numerals, respectively). The last occurrence of one of these
            characters in the format string is used - previous ones are
            assumed to be part of the format.</p><a id="data-change" name=
            "data-change">

            <h4>Change Selections</h4>

            <p>Finally, the "Change Selected Data" command allows the values
            of a data field to be changed simultaneously for all selected
            nodes. Simply select the desired field and enter the new value.
            To erase field values, enter a character then delete it - this
            will indicate that a blank field is desired.</p>

          <h3>Printing</h3>

          <div>
            <a id="print-options" name="print-options">

            <h4>Print Options</h4>

            <p>The "File-&gt;Print Options dialog's first tab is "General
            Options". On the left, printing of the entire tree, the selected
            branches (all descendants) or the selected nodes can be selected.
            The first two options print all of the descendants with the
            children indented.<br>
            <br>
            On the right are options for drawing tree structure lines,
            including the root node, including only open children and keeping
            the first child with its parent. The tree structure lines are
            drawn to connect parent and child nodes. They can make
            parent/child relationships easier to visualize, especially across
            multiple pages. The lines may not display as desired when using
            some HTML formatting tags.<br>
            <br>
            By default, TreeLine will avoid breaking pages between a parent
            and its first child. This behavior can be disabled by disabling
            the "Keep first child with parent" option.</p><a id="print-setup"
            name="print-setup">

            <h4>Page Setup</h4>

            <p>The second tab of the "Print Options" dialog box is "Page
            Setup". On the left are settings for page size, orientation and
            units. On the right are settings for columns, indent offsets, and
            margins.</p><a id="print-font" name="print-font">

            <h4>Printer Font</h4>

            <p>The third tab of the "Print Options" dialog box is "Font
            Selection". The printout will use the same font as the "Data
            Output" pane if the upper check box is checked. If it is
            unchecked, a font can be selected specifically for
            printing.</p><a id="print-header" name="print-header">

            <h4>Header and Footer</h4>

            <p>The fourth tab on the "Print Options" dialog is used to set
            the print header and footer. There are file info fields on the
            left and six header/footer edit boxes (left, center and right
            justified) on the right. These fields can be added and combined
            with other text in the edit boxes, just like in the "Output" tab
            of the "Data-&gt;Configure Data Types" dialog. The header and
            footer settings are saved with the TreeLine file.</p><a id=
            "print-preview" name="print-preview">

            <h4>Print Preview</h4>

            <p>The print preview window can be shown by using the
            "File-&gt;Print Preview" menu or with the button on the "Print
            Options" dialog. Buttons on the window are used to navigate
            between pages, open the "Print Options" dialog, or open the print
            dialog. The print preview will show more detail if its window is
            made larger.</p><a id="print-problems" name="print-problems">

            <h4>Printing Problems</h4>

            <p>Some printing problems, especially problems with margins and
            word-wrapping, can be eliminated by changing the print font to a
            font that is better supported by the printer.</p>

            <a id="file-comp" name="file-comp">

            <h4>File Compression</h4>

            <p>A TreeLine file is in an XML text format. There are also
            options to work with compressed files (gzip format) to save
            space. Individual files can be set to compressed mode from either
            "Tools-&gt;File Options" or from the save-as dialog. There is
            also a general option to set the default mode for new
            files.</p><a id="file-enc" name="file-enc">

            <h4>File Encryption</h4>

            <p>There is a file encryption option to password protect TreeLine
            files. Individual files can be set to encrypted mode from either
            "Tools-&gt;File Options" or from the save-as dialog. There is
            also a general option to set the default for new files. The
            encryption uses the SHA hash function as a stream cipher - it
            should be fairly secure.</p><a id="file-auto-save" name=
            "file-auto-save">

            <h4>Auto-Save</h4>

            <p>An auto-save feature can store unsaved files with a "~"
            appended to the file name. The backup files are automatically
            removed when the file is saved or TreeLine exits cleanly. The
            auto-save time interval is set in the general options. Setting
            the interval to zero disables this feature.</p><a id=
            "file-states" name="file-states">

            <h4>Saved Tree States</h4>

            <p>When opening a recently used file, TreeLine will restore the
            states of open and selected nodes. This information is stored in
            the user's TreeLine configuration file. If desired, this feature
            can be disabled with a general option.</p><a id="file-cmdline"
            name="file-cmdline">

            <h4>Command Line</h4>

            <p>Command line options allow non-interactive file importing and
            exporting. This allows automated runs to be scheduled. For more
            details, run "treeline -h" (or "treeline_dos -h" in Windows) from
            the command line.</p>

          <h3>File Import</h3>

          <div>
            <a id="import-general" name="import-general">

            <h4>General Information</h4>

            <p>A TreeLine file is in an XML text format. Other types of text
            files can be imported simply by opening them. Opening a file that
            is not valid TreeLine XML will result in a prompt for the type of
            import desired.</p><a id="import-delim" name="import-delim">

            <h4>Delimited Text</h4>

            <p>TreeLine will open a text file with a tree structure
            represented by tabs before each line. In this case, only the node
            title is imported, without any extra fields.<br>
            <br>
            A tab-delimited table can also be imported. It becomes a single
            level of children under the root node, with each node containing
            fields from each table column. The first row of the table is used
            as field names and each subsequent row becomes a node.</p><a id=
            "import-plain" name="import-plain">

            <h4>Plain Text</h4>

            <p>There are two types of plain text import. One creates a
            separate node for each line in the file. The other creates a node
            for each paragraph, assuming the paragraphs are separated by
            blank lines. In both cases, the resulting TreeLine file will have
            all of the text under a single parent, but it is a good starting
            point. Additional structure can be added later.</p><a id=
            "import-treepad" name="import-treepad">

            <h4>Treepad Files</h4>

            <p>There is also a filter to import files from the Treepad
            shareware program. Only Treepad text nodes are
            supported.</p><a id="import-bookmarks" name="import-bookmarks">

            <h4>Bookmark Files</h4>

            <p>TreeLine will import bookmark files in both the Mozilla HTML
            format (Mozilla, Firefox and Netscape browsers) and the XBEL
            format (Konqueror, Galeon and Elinks browsers). Each bookmark
            becomes a node with a name and a link field. Some information in
            the files, such as visited dates and icon references, is not
            imported. For an example, see the "sample_bookmarks" file (by
            using the "File-&gt;Open Sample" command).</p><a id="import-xml"
            name="import-xml">

            <h4>Generic XML</h4>

            <p>TreeLine will import and export generic XML files. These
            routines do not have much intelligence - each XML element becomes
            a node and each XML attribute becomes a field. XML text content
            become fields named "Element_Data". This lets TreeLine function
            as a crude XML editor.</p><a id="import-odf" name="import-odf">

            <h4>ODF Text Document</h4>

            <p>TreeLine will import Open Document Format (ODF) text
            documents, from applications such as OpenOffice.org and KWord.
            The node structure is formed based on the heading styles assigned
            in the document. Any text under each heading is assigned to that
            heading's node. The import filter is intended for simple text
            outlines only. No formatting is maintained, and objects such as
            tables and pictures are not imported.</p>
          </div><a id="export" name="export">

          <h3>File Export</h3>

          <div>
            <a id="export-general" name="export-general">

            <h4>General Information</h4>

            <p>Files are exported using the "File-&gt;Export" command. This
            will show a dialog box of available export types and
            options.</p><a id="export-html" name="export-html">

            <h4>HTML</h4>

            <p>Single-file HTML output is similar to printing, with similar
            options. It can include the print header and footer in the HTML,
            and the number of columns can be set.<br>
            <br>
            There are also two multiple-file HTML export functions that
            create directory structures. Directories are named for the
            content of the reference data field, which must contain legal
            file names and not have duplicates under the same parent. The
            first form creates a table in each HTML file that contains the
            data for a set of siblings, as well as links to the parent and
            child pages. The second form creates an HTML page for every node,
            with a navigation pane on the left side of each page that
            contains links to the node's parent, uncles and
            children.</p><a id="export-delim" name="export-delim">

            <h4>Delimited Text</h4>

            <p>Data can be exported to tabbed title text and tab-delimited
            tables. These formats are the same as the corresponding import
            formats. When exporting to a table, only the first level of
            children is used, so you may wish to flatten the data before
            exporting.</p><a id="export-bookmarks" name="export-bookmarks">

            <h4>Bookmark Files</h4>

            <p>TreeLine will export bookmark files in both the Mozilla HTML
            format (Mozilla, Firefox and Netscape browsers) and the XBEL
            format (Konqueror, Galeon and Elinks browsers).</p><a id=
            "export-xml" name="export-xml">

            <h4>Generic XML</h4>

            <p>TreeLine will import and export generic XML files. These
            routines do not have much intelligence - each node becomes an XML
            element and each field becomes an XML attribute, except for
            fields named "Element_Data" that become the element's text. This
            lets TreeLine function as a crude XML editor.</p><a id=
            "export-xslt" name="export-xslt">

            <h4>XSLT</h4>

            <p>In addition to exporting data, the format for a file can be
            exported to an XSLT file. This can be used to display the XML
            data from a native TreeLine file in a compliant browser without
            exporting the data to HTML. Recent versions of most browsers are
            XSLT compliant. Note that complex field type formatting will be
            ignored by the XSLT.<br>
            <br>
            When exporting to XSLT, a link to the XSL file is added to the
            TreeLine file. Note that the TreeLine file must then be saved. In
            general, the TreeLine file should have a .xml extension so that
            the TreeLine file can be opened directly in a compliant browser.
            After that, the XSL file does not need to be re-exported for data
            changes (only for formatting changes).<br>
            <br>
            If HTML tags are used in data formats that will be exported to
            XSLT, they should use xHTML style (&lt;br /&gt; instead of
            &lt;br&gt;). When exporting, there is a prompt for the name of an
            optional style sheet (css). This name is stored in the TreeLine
            file as the default for future exports. Also, the reference to
            the XSLT file in the TreeLine file may be removed with the
            "Tools-&gt;Remove XSLT Reference" command.</p><a id="export-odf"
            name="export-odf">

            <h4>ODF Text Document</h4>

            <p>TreeLine will export an outline to an Open Document Format
            (ODF) text document, compatible with OpenOffice.org and KWord.
            The title of each node is assigned a heading style at the
            appropriate level. Any other text in the output of each node
            becomes normal text under the heading. The export filter is
            intended for simple text outlines only. Any HTML formatting is
            stripped, and objects such as tables and pictures are not
            supported.</p>

            <a id="custom-options" name="custom-options">

            <h4>Options</h4>

            <p>TreeLine's behavior can be modified with several settings
            available in "Tools-&gt;General Options". Most of these options
            are covered elsewhere in this document.<br>
            <br>
            Under Windows, a "treeline.ini" file in the user's application
            settings directory is used by default to store the settings. For
            portable use of TreeLine, that file can be manually moved to
            TreeLine's "lib" directory. Once it exists, a "treeline.ini" file
            in the "lib" directory will be used and updated automatically if
            the file isn't also in the user's application settings
            directory.</p><a id="custom-fonts" name="custom-fonts">

            <h4>Description</h4>

            <p>TreeLine has an interface to plugin extension modules. This
            allows extensions to be written by various coders that provide
            functionality needed by a few users without adding bloat to the
            main application. The plugins can add new menu items, access the
            TreeLine data and read and write TreeLine Files.<br>
            <br>
            Currently available plugins are listed on the "Downloads" page of
            the TreeLine web site.</p><a id="plugins-install" name=
            "plugins-install">

            <h4>Installation</h4>

            <p>The plugins are installed by copying their Python file (*.py)
            to a plugins directory. This can be a directory in the TreeLine
            installation ("&lt;prefix&gt;/lib/treeline/plugins/" on Linux or
            "TreeLine\lib\plugins\" on Windows) or in the user configuration
            directory ("~/.treeline-1.x/plugins/" on Linux, "Documents and
            Settings\&lt;user&gt;\Application
            Data\bellz\treeline-1.x\plugins\" on Windows). A list of loaded
            plugins can be found using the "Help-&gt;About Plugins"
            command.</p><a id="plugins-intrf" name="plugins-intrf">

            <h4>Interface</h4>

            <p>Information about writing new plugins can be found in the

            <h4>Closed Panes</h4>

            <p>If one of the view panes is not visible when it should contain
            data, it has probably been collapsed to a size of zero. This can
            apply to the left pane and to the upper and lower right panes. To
            fix this, look for a thin stripe along one of the view borders
            that can be dragged back into its proper position.</p><a id=

            <h4>XML Error</h4>

            <p>An error message, "Error loading XML Parser", typically means
            that TreeLine could not find a necessary XML library. Under
            Linux, Python uses external libraries for parsing. Installing
            either the expat library or the PyXML package should fix the
            problem. Under Windows, Python includes a parser, so this error
            should not be seen unless files are missing or corrupt.</p><a id=

            <h4>Printing</h4>

            <p>Some printing problems, especially problems with margins and
            word-wrapping, can be eliminated by changing the print font to a
            font that is better supported by the printer.</p>

                <li>The file browser used for editing path-based fields now
                remembers the previously used directory.</li>

                <li>Added icons for the New Window and Close Window commands
                so they can be added to toolbars.</li>
              </ul>

            <h4>Bug Fixes:</h4>

            <div>
              <ul>
                <li>Fixed a bug that could keep the column control from being
                enabled during HTML export.</li>
              </ul>
            </div>

            <h4>Major New Features Since 1.2.x:</h4>

            <div>
              <ul>
                <li>Different files can be open in multiple TreeLine windows
                within the same TreeLine session. This is controlled with
                commands in the new "Window" menu.</li>

                <li>The "Window-&gt;New Window" command creates a new window
                with views of the same TreeLine file. Changes in either
                window are saved in the same document.</li>

                <li>Starting TreeLine (from a shortcut, file association or
                command line) will activate an existing TreeLine session if
                it is already running.</li>

                <li>An "Add internal link" context menu has been added to
                text boxes in the data editor. It prompts for another node to
                be clicked with the mouse, then an inline internal link is
                added with that node's reference information.</li>

                <li>Added an "HTML directory pages" export option. This will
                export a directory structure with an HTML file for every
                node. A navigation pane on the left side of each page
                contains links to nearby nodes.</li>

                <li>New dialog buttons will restore the default configuration
                when customizing toolbars or shortcuts.</li>

                <li>A new text search function has been added to the help
                viewer.</li>
              </ul>

                <li>Added a menu command that updates another window
                containing the same file (without waiting for a focus
                change). This command also has a keyboard shortcut
                (Ctrl+W).</li>

                <li>A menu option has been added to hide the status bar.
                There is also a new general option to hide it at startup. A

                important messages.</li>

                <li>A new button on the toolbar editing dialog will restore

                <li>The Change Selected Data command has been updated to use

                reports are appreciated, but the stable release (TreeLine
                1.2.x) should be used for critical work.</li>

                <li>The documentation has not yet been updated to cover the
                new features.</li>

            <div>
              <ul>
                <li>Multiple TreeLine windows with different files can be
                open within the same TreeLine session. The "Open files in new
                windows" general option controls whether new windows are used
                when opening or creating files.</li>

                <li>A "Window" menu has been added with commands to create
                new windows, close windows, or select from a list of current
                windows.</li>

                <li>The "Window-&gt;New Window" command creates a new window
                with views of the same TreeLine file. Changes in either
                window are saved in the same document. This can be used to
                work in different sections of the file simultaneously. For
                performance reasons, the non-active window does not show the
                changes made in the active window until the non-active window
                is focused.</li>

                <li>Starting TreeLine (from a shortcut, file association or
                command line) will activate an existing TreeLine session if
                it is already running. A new window will be opened if an
                unopened file was specified by file association or in the
                command line.</li>

                <li>An "Add internal link" context menu has been added to
                text boxes in the data editor. It prompts for another node to
                be clicked with the mouse, then an inline internal link is
                added with that node's reference information.</li>

                <li>Added an "HTML directory pages" export option. This will
                export to a directory structure with an HTML file for every
                node. A navigation pane on the left side of each page
                contains links to the node's parent, uncles and
                children.</li>
              </ul>

                columns for better viewing on small, wide displays.</li>

                <li>Additional export commands and export options have been
                added to the plugin interface.</li>

                <li>To avoid a problem on the Mac platform, when TreeLine is
                run for the first time, it lets the OS determine the window
                position.</li>

                1.2.2 unusable on Windows 98.</li>

                <li>Data copied to the Windows clipboard is now preserved

                <li>Substituted some imported modules to avoid deprecation
                warnings in Python 2.6. Note that Python 2.3 is no longer
                supported.</li>

                <li>The windows binary has been updated to use Python 2.6,
                and the installer has been tweaked to reduce DLL
                conflicts.</li>

                <li>Fixed problems using the tab key to change focus from the
                tree to the data editor.</li>

                <li>ID numbers are now properly assigned to new nodes with
                UniqueID fields in the title.</li>

          <h3>November 4, 2008 - Release 1.2.1 (stable release)</h3>

          <div>
            <h4>Bug Fixes:</h4>

            <div>
              <ul>
                <li>Fix the loss of entered text when the renaming of a node
                is ended by a command that changes the selected node.</li>

                <li>Problems with opening files with Unicode file names from
                the command line or from a file association have been
                fixed.</li>

                <li>Fixed problems with JPEG and GIF image support in the
                Windows binary build.</li>

                <li>When commands change the tree view, it no longer scrolls
                vertically unless the current node is not visible.</li>

                <li>Fixed problems with files set to both compressed and
                encrypted modes. But note that compressing an encrypted file
                still does not significantly reduce its size.</li>

                <li>Problems on the Macintosh platform with detecting the
                text encoding and with setting the default theme have been
                fixed.</li>

          <h3>June 17, 2008 - Release 1.2.0 (new stable release)</h3>

          <div>
            <h4>Notes:</h4>

            <div>
              <ul>
                <li>This is a new stable release, ending the 1.1.x
                development series.</li>

                <li>This release is only available in English and French. The
                1.0.2 release is still available, including German,
                Portuguese, Russian and Spanish translations. Volunteers to
                update the translations are welcome.</li>
              </ul>
            </div>

            <h4>Updates:</h4>

            <div>
              <ul>
                <li>The French translations of the GUI and the ReadMe file
                have been updated.</li>
              </ul>
            </div>

            <h4>Bug Fixes:</h4>

            <div>
              <ul>
                <li>When restoring an auto-saved backup file, TreeLine no
                longer replaces a the main file with the backup if the backup
                is not a valid TreeLine file.</li>

                <li>Fixed a minor bug in the Configure Data Types dialog
                caused by unselecting a field in the Output pane.</li>
              </ul>
            </div>

            <h4>Major New Features Since 1.0.x:</h4>

            <div>
              <ul>
                <li>TreeLine was extensively rewritten to port it to the Qt4
                library (previous versions used Qt3.x on Linux and Qt2.3 on
                Windows). Benefits include updated widgets and removal of the
                non-commercial license exception in Windows.</li>

                <li>Preformatted templates have been added for new TreeLine
                documents. User-created templates can also be added.</li>

                <li>The content of right-hand views varies based on the
                selection and other options. A single selection still shows
                panes with the parent and its children, but a multiple
                selection will show all of the selected nodes in a single
                pane. Also, the Data Output view can optionally show an
                indented view of all descendants, and the Data Editor view
                splits the display into pages to speed up display.</li>

                <li>More commands can make use of a multiple selection
                instead of just using the single active node. Also, an option
                can set the sequence of showing and exporting multiple
                selections to either tree order or selection order.</li>

                <li>There is a tab on the left-hand view for a flat node list
                showing the selected nodes and all of their descendants. It
                is most useful for showing the results of filtering. There is
                a conditional filter for specific rules and a text filter
                that searches all fields for a string.</li>

                <li>Several dialogs have been reworked for usability. The
                Configure Data Types and Print Options dialogs use tabs for
                better organization. The Configure dialog also has initially
                hidden advanced features and is now modeless, so it can be
                left open while applying configuration changes. The Sort,
                Export and Print Preview dialogs have also been updated.</li>

                <li>Navigation through the tree is simplified by new commands
                that step through the selection history. Also, search strings
                are now highlighted in the Data Output view for text
                searches.</li>

                <li>New dialogs have been added to customize keyboard
                shortcuts and tool bar buttons. There is also a directory for
                user-defined tree icons.</li>

                <li>New file import and export options convert between an
                outline and an Open Document Format (ODF) text document,
                compatible with OpenOffice.org and KWord. Formatting is not
                maintained.</li>

                <li>A Unique ID field type has been added that is
                automatically loaded with unique numbers. It is useful for
                link references.</li>
              </ul>

          <h3>January 15, 2008 - Release 1.1.10 (unstable development
          snapshot)</h3>

          <div>
            <h4>Notes:</h4>

            <div>
              <ul>
                <li>This is an unstable development snapshot. It is nearly
                ready to become a stable release, but it could still contain
                bugs. Testing and bug reports are appreciated.</li>

                <li>The French translation of the GUI is the only one
                completed so far. None of the documentation translations have
                been updated.</li>

                <li>On Linux, running TreeLine requires Qt version 4.1 or
                higher and PyQt version 4.0 or higher. Binary packages may
                not be available yet for these libraries in some
                distributions.</li>

                <li>If you've installed previous development releases, it is
                recommended that you delete the old configuration file
                ("~/.treeline-1.1/treelinerc" on Linux, "Documents and
                Settings\&lt;login&gt;\Application

            <h4>Updates:</h4>

            <div>
              <ul>
                <li>Exporting to HTML directories has been improved. The file
                names are generated from the reference field (were from the
                first field). Internal links to nodes now work properly in
                the exported files.</li>

                <li>When saving a new file, the Save-As dialog now defaults
                to the top directory in the recent file list.</li>

                <li>A translation of the GUI in French is now available. The
                i18n installation file is a separate download.</li>

                <li>The ReadMe documentation file has been updated to clarify
                certain usage issues.</li>
              </ul>
            </div>

            <h4>Bug Fixes:</h4>

            <div>
              <ul>
                <li>The other controls in the configuration dialog are
                updated immediately when setting a data type to be derived
                from a generic.</li>

                <li>A recent file list bug that affected the httpload plugin
                has been fixed. Also, a library need by the plugin (urllib)
                has been added to the Windows installation.</li>

                <li>An error message about removing a status bar widget has
                been eliminated.</li>

                <li>An error on a Mac when setting the language encoding has
                been fixed.</li>

                <li>Various issues with file paths containing Unicode
                characters have been fixed.</li>

          <h3>April 17, 2007 - Release 1.1.6 (unstable development
          snapshot)</h3>

          <div>
            <h4>Notes:</h4>

            <div>
              <ul>
                <li>This is an unstable development snapshot. It is not
                feature complete and probably contains bugs. Testing and bug
                reports are appreciated, but the stable release (TreeLine
                1.0.x) should be used for critical work.</li>

                <li>The documentation and GUI translations have not been
                updated.</li>

                <li>On Linux, running TreeLine requires Qt version 4.1 or
                higher and PyQt version 4.0 or higher. Binary packages are
                not yet available for these libraries in some
                distributions.</li>

                <li>If you've installed previous development releases, it is
                recommended that you delete the old configuration file
                ("~/.treeline-1.1/treelinerc" on Linux, "Documents and
                Settings\&lt;login&gt;\Application
                Data\bellz\treeline-1.1\treeline.ini" on Windows) before
                running this release.</li>
              </ul>
            </div>

            <h4>New Features:</h4>

            <div>
              <ul>
                <li>A new command (View-&gt;Show Output Descendants) toggles
                the Data Output child view from showing only child nodes to
                showing an indented view of all descendant nodes. A button
                was added to the default toolbar for this command. Also, a
                new general option can make the descendant view the default
                at startup.</li>

                <li>A new file export option converts an outline to an Open
                Document Format (ODF) text document, compatible with
                OpenOffice.org and KWord. The title of each node is assigned
                a heading style at the appropriate level. Any other text in
                the output of each node becomes normal text under the
                heading. Any HTML formatting is stripped.</li>

                <li>ODF text documents can be imported. The node structure is
                based on the heading styles assigned in the document. Any
                text under each heading is assigned to that heading's node.
                Formatting is not maintained.</li>
              </ul>
            </div>

            <h4>Updates:</h4>

            <div>
              <ul>
                <li>New commands were added to the Data Editor context menus
                that open the Configure Data Types dialog with the editor's
                type and/or field already selected.</li>

                <li>Keyboard shortcuts were added for the commands that add
                HTML tags in the Data Editor. Icons were also added to these
                commands, so the toolbar editor can be used to place them on
                a toolbar if desired.</li>

                <li>The interface for writing plugin modules was improved by
                adding interfaces to the keyboard shortcut editor and the
                toolbar editor. Also, a plugin interface to get the plugin's
                directory was added.</li>

                <li>Any default text for new fields is added when a node's
                data type is changed (not just to a new node), as long as
                there isn't already data in a field with the same name.</li>
              </ul>
            </div>

            <h4>Bug Fixes:</h4>

            <div>
              <ul>
                <li>Fixed a problem with the automatic opening of the last
                file used if there are no valid recent files.</li>

                <li>Fixed a crash at file open if the file's owner is not
                found in a Linux machine's user password database.</li>

                <li>Issues with the display of text have been fixed if the Qt
                library being used is version 4.2.3 or greater (the Windows
                build now uses 4.2.3). These issues showed up when scroll
                bars were shown and could hide the right edge of the text or
                the last line.</li>

                <li>Multiple issues with dragging or pasting nodes between
                sessions of TreeLine were fixed.</li>

                <li>If the Configure Data Types dialog is open, it is
                properly updated after the use of the undo command.</li>

                <li>The find dialog is properly focused when repeatedly
                shown.</li>

                <li>Fixed problems occurring when attempting to print an
                empty branch or an empty selection.</li>

                <li>Fixed problems with the export of HTML directories. It
                now removes illegal characters from directory names created
                from field contents.</li>

                <li>Auto choice fields are now properly updated after
                configuration changes.</li>

                <li>A missing help menu was added to the Unique ID field
                format editor.</li>
              </ul>

          <h3>February 22, 2007 - Release 1.1.5 (unstable development
          snapshot)</h3>

          <div>
            <h4>Notes:</h4>

            <div>
              <ul>
                <li>This is an unstable development snapshot. It is not
                feature complete and probably contains bugs. Testing and bug
                reports are appreciated, but the stable release (TreeLine
                1.0.0) should be used for critical work.</li>

                <li>The documentation and GUI translations have not been
                updated.</li>

                <li>On Linux, running TreeLine requires Qt version 4.1 or
                higher and PyQt version 4.0 or higher. Binary packages are
                not yet available for these libraries in some
                distributions.</li>

                <li>If you've installed previous development releases, it is
                recommended that you delete the old configuration file
                ("~/.treeline-1.1/treelinerc" on Linux, "Documents and
                Settings\&lt;login&gt;\Application
                Data\bellz\treeline-1.1\treeline.ini" on Windows) before
                running this release.</li>
              </ul>
            </div>

            <h4>New Features:</h4>

            <div>
              <ul>
                <li>A Unique ID field type has been added. The field is
                automatically loaded with unique numbers. Initially, the
                field's format string is set to the desired first number in
                the series, with optional leading zeros and optional leading
                or trailing characters. All nodes of the data type will get
                an automatically assigned ID. The field format string will
                always show the next available number, which will be given to
                the next new node of that type.</li>

                <li>The node sorting commands have been consolidated into a
                single new dialog. This provides more options for selecting
                what to sort (all nodes, branches, children or siblings) and
                how (by types and fields or by titles).</li>

                <li>An option has been added to the numbering dialog to only
                number nodes where the number field already exists. This
                allows node types in the branch that do not have the number
                field to be skipped.</li>
              </ul>
            </div>

            <h4>Updates:</h4>

            <div>
              <ul>
                <li>The tree view no longer scrolls horizontally when the
                selection is changed.</li>

                <li>The focus behavior of the Data Editor view has been
                tweaked to allow easier tabbing between widgets.</li>

                <li>Clicking on a selected node to rename it is now disabled
                when multiple nodes are selected. This avoids initiating a
                rename when the intent was to modify a multiple
                selection.</li>

                <li>The Insert Sibling Before command has been added to the
                node right-click context menu for consistency.</li>

                <li>The Spell Check dialog is no longer hidden and re-shown
                between each misspelled word, resulting in smoother
                operation.</li>

                <li>The Output tab of the Configure Data Types dialog has
                been adjusted to avoid changing the dialog size when toggling
                the advanced options.</li>

                <li>The fonts in the Print Options dialog are sorted case
                insensitively, and the size of the dialog is fixed regardless
                of the selected font.</li>
              </ul>
            </div>

            <h4>Bug Fixes:</h4>

            <div>
              <ul>
                <li>Fixed a crash when opening a file with the flat view
                shown.</li>

                <li>Fixed problems occurring when the number of toolbars was
                set to zero.</li>

                <li>Fixed undo operations for Numbering, data Add Category
                Level and Arrange by Reference commands.</li>

                <li>Fixed problems with undo and delete commands issued while
                a node is being renamed.</li>

                <li>Fixed problems with renaming data types and fields in the
                Configure Data Types dialog.</li>

                <li>Avoid adding duplicate types to Other Field References in
                the advanced Output tab of the Configure Data Types
                dialog.</li>

                <li>No longer allow the Edit Cut command to operate if the
                root node is selected.</li>

                <li>Fixed a freeze of the spell checker on some
                platforms.</li>

                <li>An empty rectangle that was sometimes shown on the status
                line at the bottom of the main window has been removed.</li>

                <li>An occasional problem with the import of generic XML was
                fixed.</li>

                <li>The importing of files with bad Unicode characters has
                been improved.</li>

                <li>The restoring of tree states when opening a file has been
                made more robust.</li>

                <li>Fixed several other minor tracebacks that can show up in
                a terminal or log file.</li>

            <h4>Notes:</h4>

            <div>
              <ul>
                <li>This is an unstable development snapshot. It is not

                <li>The documentation and GUI translations have not been
                updated.</li>

                <li>On Linux, running TreeLine requires Qt version 4.1 or
                higher and PyQt version 4.0 or higher. Binary packages are
                not yet available for these libraries in some
                distributions.</li>
              </ul>
            </div>

            <h4>New Features:</h4>

            <div>
              <ul>
                <li>Previous and Next Selection commands have been added to
                the View menu. These commands step through a history of tree
                selections for quicker navigation.</li>

                <li>When using the Find command with the Data Output view
                visible, the search string occurrences are highlighted in the
                output. Note: in Linux, this feature requires Qt v4.2 or
                greater and PyQt v4.1 or greater.</li>

                <li>An icons directory has been added to the user
                configuration directory ("~/.treeline-1.1/icons" on Linux,
                "Documents and Settings\&lt;user&gt;\Application
                Data\bellz\treeline-1.1\icons" on Windows). Image files (PNG
                or BMP) placed into this directory are available for use as
                tree icons.</li>

                <li>"Move First" and "Move Last" commands have been added to
                the Edit menu. These commands move a child node to be the
                first or last child of its parent.</li>
              </ul>
            </div>

            <h4>Updates:</h4>

            <div>
              <ul>
                <li>Horizontal scrolling of the tree view when the contents
                are wide is now supported.</li>

                <li>The non-interactive command line options have been ported
                from the stable version. These options allow batch processing
                of file imports and exports.</li>

                <li>Support for plugin extension modules has been ported from
                the stable version. The interfaces to TreeLine functions are
                unchanged, but existing plugins will need to be ported to the
                Qt4 library. An updated version of the httpLoad plugin is
                available.</li>

                <li>A plugins directory has been added to the user
                configuration directory. This allows plugin installation
                without elevated privileges.</li>

                <li>The code required to support GUI translations has been
                ported from the stable version, but the actual translations
                have not yet been updated.</li>
              </ul>

            <div>
              <ul>
                <li>The problem with cut/copy/paste operations in Windows
                that produced an error message at application exit was
                fixed.</li>

                <li>Fixed several problems with the undo of changes to the
                Data Type Configuration.</li>

                <li>A bug that could sometimes add an extra node during
                renaming in the Tree View has been fixed.</li>

                <li>Problems encountered when typing a replacement word
                during spell check have been fixed.</li>

                <li>A spell check language setting in File Options that is
                not available on the system is now ignored.</li>

          snapshot)</h3>

          <div>
            <h4>Notes:</h4>

            <div>
              <ul>
                <li>This is an unstable development snapshot. It is not
                feature complete and is sure to contain bugs. Testing and bug
                reports are appreciated, but the stable release (TreeLine
                1.0.0) should be used for any critical work.</li>

                <li>Some features from the stable release are not yet
                implemented here. These include command line options, plugin
                support and translation support. Also, the documentation has
                not been updated.</li>

                <li>On Linux, running TreeLine requires Qt version 4.1 or
                higher and PyQt version 4.0 or higher. Binary packages are
                not yet available for these libraries in some
                distributions.</li>

                <li>One known bug in the Windows version produces an error
                message at application exit if cut/copy/paste operations were
                done during the session.</li>
              </ul>
            </div>

            <h4>New Features:</h4>

            <div>
              <ul>
                <li>A new built-in editor for keyboard shortcuts has been
                added to the Tools menu. It has two tabs: one for menu
                commands and one for other commands. Simply press the desired
                key combination to change the shortcut in the selected entry.
                In general, printable characters without Ctrl or Alt
                modifiers should not be used for shortcuts. Although the
                editor will accept them, they may not work properly when
                certain widgets are focused.</li>

                <li>A dialog to customize the tool bars has been added. It is
                accessed from the Tools menu. This allows the user to select
                small or large icons, define the number of tool bars, and
                define the commands included in each tool bar.</li>

            <div>
              <ul>
                <li>The saving of node open/close states for recently opened
                files has been ported from the stable version.</li>

                <li>The restoring of splitter sizes and the active right-hand
                tab from the previous session has been ported from the stable
                version.</li>

                <li>The TreeLine configuration files now include a version
                number (.treeline-1.1 on Linux, treeline-1.1.ini on Windows)
                to avoid incompatibility issues with previous versions.</li>

                <li>The default non-menu keyboard shortcuts have been changed
                to control-key sequences that function regardless of the
                focused widget.</li>

                <li>The incremental node title search has been ported from
                the stable version. The default keyboard shortcut is now
                Ctrl+/.</li>

                <li>The option to add a node when pressing the enter key has
                been ported from the stable version.</li>
              </ul>
            </div>

            <div>
              <ul>
                <li>Searching for nodes with the flat view active now only
                finds nodes actually present in the flat view.</li>

                <li>Problems with drag &amp; drop of nodes with Unicode
                content were fixed.</li>

                <li>The Icon Selection dialog under Configure Data Types now
                scrolls to the currently selected icon when opened.</li>

          snapshot)</h3>

          <div>
            <h4>Notes:</h4>

            <div>
              <ul>
                <li>This is an unstable development snapshot. It is not
                feature complete and is sure to contain bugs. Testing and bug
                reports are appreciated, but the stable release (TreeLine
                1.0.0) should be used for any critical work.</li>

                <li>Several features from the stable release are not yet
                implemented here. These include keyboard shortcuts for
                non-menu items, command line options, plugin support and
                translation support. Also, restoring of tree node open/close
                states, window split locations and active tabs are not yet
                available. And the documentation has not been updated.</li>

                <li>On Linux, running TreeLine requires Qt version 4.1 or
                higher and PyQt version 4.0 or higher. Binary packages are
                not yet available for these libraries in some
                distributions.</li>

                <li>One known bug in the Windows version produces an error
                message at application exit if cut/copy/paste operations were
                done during the session.</li>
              </ul>
            </div>

            <h4>New Features:</h4>

            <div>
              <ul>
                <li>Printing functionality has been added to the development
                series. It now includes options to print the entire tree, the
                selected branches, or just the selected nodes.</li>

                <li>A new Print Options dialog box is tabbed to give easier
                access to all of the options. There are buttons that give a
                more logical progression from the options to the print
                preview and to the print dialog.</li>
              </ul>
            </div>

            <h4>Updates:</h4>

            <div>
              <ul>
                <li>The buttons at the bottom of the Configure Data Types
                dialog have been changed to OK/Apply/Reset/Cancel. This can
                reduce the number of mouse clicks.</li>

                <li>The Configure Data Types dialog now defaults to the
                selected node's type when it is shown.</li>

                <li>On Windows, the TreeLine.ini file has been moved from the
                installation directory to a location under the "Documents and
                Settings" folder. This avoids problems on multi-user systems
                and for users with limited access rights.</li>
              </ul>
            </div>

            <div>
              <ul>
                <li>The Configure Data Types dialog now updates properly
                after copying types from another file, adding numbering, and
                rearranging by category and reference.</li>

                <li>Various problems with node drag &amp; drop that could
                result in inadvertent drops were fixed.</li>

                <li>A bug that caused the right-hand view splitter to reset
                to even sizes was fixed.</li>

                <li>Problems with saving changes to the format of file
                information fields were fixed.</li>

                <li>Issues with some internal links and pictures in the help

              </ul>
            </div>

            <h4>New Features:</h4>

            <div>
              <ul>
                <li>TreeLine was ported to the Qt4 library. This involved a
                major rewrite of the code. The previous versions used Qt3.x
                on Linux and Qt2.3 on Windows. Benefits include updated
                widgets and removal of the non-commercial license exception
                in Windows.</li>

                <li>The Configure Data Types dialog uses tabs for better
                organization. Many tabs contain advanced features that can be
                shown if desired. The dialog is also modeless, so it can be
                left open while applying configuration changes.</li>

                <li>The content of the right-hand view varies based on the
                kinds of nodes selected. With a single parent node selected,
                it splits the view, showing the parent and its children (same
                as version 1.0.0). With a multiple selection or with a
                childless node selected, it shows all of the selected nodes
                in a single pane.</li>

                <li>A general option sets the sequence for multiple selection
                to either tree order or selected order. When nodes are
                selected with control-click under the selected order option,
                they show in the right-hand view in the order they were
                picked. This sequence also applies to copy and export
                commands.</li>

                <li>More commands make use of a multiple selection instead of
                just using the single active node. For example, the paste
                command will add duplicate children under each selected
                destination node.</li>

                <li>The export command includes options to export the entire
                tree, the selected branches, or just the selected nodes.</li>

                <li>In order to render the Data Editor right-hand view
                faster, there is a general option to set the number of
                "pages" initially shown. By default, only one page is shown.
                Buttons allow toggling to the next page or all pages.</li>

                <li>There is a tab on the left-hand view to show a flat node
                list. It shows the initially selected nodes and all of their
                descendants. It is probably most useful when using filtering
                commands.</li>

                <li>A conditional filter selects nodes based on rules for
                specific data types and fields, and a text filter selects
                based on finding the given text in any field. Both filters
                show their results in the tabbed "Flat View" and remain in
                effect until removed.</li>

                <li>In the advanced mode, a child count field reference can
                be added to the output configuration. It shows the number of
                children at a specified descendant level.</li>

            <h4>Updates:</h4>

            <div>
              <ul>
                <li>A new version numbering system is being introduced. This
                release is 1.0.0, to better indicate its stability. The 1.1.x
                series will be started soon for less stable development
                releases.</li>

                <li>The German translation of the ReadMe file has been

                suffixes. Thanks to Roland Meister for supplying
                patches.</li>

                <li>Added functions to the plugin interface to allow plugins
                to open and close nodes.</li>
              </ul>
            </div>

          <h3>December 20, 2005 - Release 0.14.0</h3>

          <div>
            <h4>New Features:</h4>

            <div>
              <ul>
                <li>Data types can be set to derive their field settings from
                a generic type. This allows types with different output
                formatting to always use the same field data. Any changes to
                the generic's list of fields and field types are
                automatically reflected in the fields of all derived types. A
                derived option can be selected when copying a type, or a
                generic type can be specified from the derived type's
                "Advanced Configuration" dialog box.</li>

                <li>Conditional expressions can be used to automatically
                assign a data type based on each node's content. Conditions
                are assigned to a generic type and its associated derived
                types. This allows the automatic assignment of different
                output formatting or different icons depending on each node's
                field data. Conditions are specified from each type's
                "Advanced Configuration" dialog box. Conditions do not have
                to be set for all types in a family, since, if no conditions
                are true for a node, the program will select a blank
                condition over a false one. In addition, conditions that are
                always "True" or "False" are available to toggle the output
                format of all nodes of a certain type simultaneously by
                modifying the condition.</li>

                <li>By default, the spell check uses dictionaries for the
                current operating system language. A new option under
                "Tools-&gt;File Options" can be used to specify an alternate
                two-letter language code for the current TreeLine file. This
                only works with aspell and with the appropriate aspell
                dictionaries available.</li>

                <li>A new menu item, "File-&gt;Open Sample", is a shortcut to
                the directory containing sample template files.</li>

                <li>A new menu item, "Help-&gt;Help Contents", directly opens
                the "Using TreeLine" section of the ReadMe file.</li>
              </ul>
            </div>

            <h4>Updates:</h4>

            <div>
              <ul>
                <li>When changing a node's type, if the result would have
                been a blank title, TreeLine now adjusts the new title fields
                to maintain the original title text.</li>

                <li>Picture links with relative paths now resolve their
                reference based on the directory containing the current
                TreeLine file.</li>

                <li>When applying a font tag in the editor view, the
                selection is maintained. This allows multiple tags to be
                applied.</li>

                <li>HTML tags in field prefixes and suffixes are now removed
                in node titles.</li>

                <li>Exported HTML has been made somewhat more compliant with
                standards.</li>

                <li>A new option on the windows installer toggles the writing
                of installation directory and uninstall information to the
                registry. When this and other options are disabled, TreeLine
                can be installed without modifying the registry.</li>

                <li>Four more sample files have been included. These files
                provide examples of using TreeLine's features and can be used
                as templates.</li>

                <li>The ReadMe file has been updated with descriptions of the
                sample files, with more internal links, and with
                screenshots.</li>
              </ul>
            </div>

            <h4>Bug Fixes:</h4>

            <div>
              <ul>
                <li>A problem with saving reference field settings for unused
                node types was fixed.</li>

                <li>Formats copied from another file are now available
                immediately.</li>

                <li>Node titles from HTML-enabled fields that contain escaped
                characters (&lt;, &gt;, &amp;) are now properly
                displayed.</li>

                <li>Fixed some minor bugs concerning setting the default
                field value for new nodes.</li>

                <li>A problem with exporting HTML directories with very
                recent versions of the PyQt library was fixed.</li>

                <li>When displaying child data in node output, extra

            <div>
              <ul>
                <li>The number of recently used files listed in the File menu
                can be set using a new general option. Note that this also
                controls how many files have their tree states (open/closed
                nodes, etc.) saved.</li>
              </ul>
            </div>

            <h4>Updates:</h4>

            <div>
              <ul>
                <li>TreeLine now sets the interface language using the LANG
                environment variable (if set) before falling back to other
                locale settings. This allows the operating system's locale
                settings to be overridden.</li>
              </ul>
            </div>

            <h4>Bug Fixes:</h4>

            <div>
              <ul>
                <li>Problems starting TreeLine when the locale's LANG
                variable ends with "@euro" have been fixed.</li>

                <li>Problems with the display of the rename edit box when
                creating new nodes in a long, scrolled tree view have been
                fixed.</li>

          <h3>August 29, 2005 - Release 0.13.0</h3>

          <div>
            <h4>New Features:</h4>

            <div>
              <ul>
                <li>The TreeLine user interface and documentation have been
                internationalized. Currently, translations are available for
                French and German. Volunteers to translate into additional
                languages are welcome.</li>

                <li>Number formats can be internationalized. Periods and
                commas are supported as radix characters, and commas, periods
                or spaces can be set as thousands separators.</li>

                <li>A new general option can set printing units to either
                inches or centimeters.</li>

                <li>An external editor can be invoked from a Data Editor text
                field context menu. The EDITOR environment variable can be
                used to specify the editor to start, or, if the variable
                doesn't exist, TreeLine will prompt for an executable to set
                as the default.</li>
              </ul>
            </div>

            <h4>Updates:</h4>

            <div>
              <ul>
                <li>The general option for a number editing format has been
                removed. Instead, the output format is displayed in the
                editor. Of course, any new entry with a reasonable format is
                correctly interpreted (but the correct radix character must
                be used).</li>

                <li>Handling of spaces in filenames for the linking fields
                have been improved. Paths with spaces selected in the file
                browser are properly quoted (Windows) or escaped
                (Linux).</li>

                <li>Page Up/Down commands in the Data Output view now leave a
                one-line overlap.</li>

                <li>A Ctrl-C interrupt in a terminal is now ignored.</li>
              </ul>
            </div>

            <h4>Bug Fixes:</h4>

            <div>
              <ul>
                <li>A dummy field has been added to imported bookmark
                separator formats to avoid configuration problems.</li>

                <li>Paths in links to XSLT files are now properly handled
                when not in the same directory as the XML file.</li>

                <li>Format text is now immediately updated when renaming
                fields.</li>

                <li>Problems with undo after complex data changes have been
                fixed.</li>

                <li>Errors due to having ASCII control characters in TreeLine
                text have been fixed.</li>

                <li>Problems with spell check of unicode characters have been

          <h3>May 4, 2005 - Release 0.12.0</h3>

          <div>
            <h4>New Features:</h4>

            <div>
              <ul>
                <li>A new AutoChoice field type provides pull-down selection
                of previously used entries. Any new entries are automatically
                added to the pull-down.</li>

                <li>A new ExecuteLink field type runs an external program
                when its link is clicked. The command to run is given by the
                text of the field. Or the field's prefix may contain the
                program name, so that the field's text is used for arguments
                or file names. There is also a general option to disable
                these links when security is a concern.</li>

                <li>A button that brings up a file browsing dialog has been
                added to the editor for Path, ExecuteLink and Picture field
                types.</li>

                <li>Link fields can display alternate text in place of the
                target URL. This is done by specifying an alternate text
                field in the Advanced Field Format dialog.</li>

                <li>Fields from child nodes can be embedded in their parent's
                output. Select a child reference from the Other Fields
                dialog. The child data is delimited with a separator string
                defined as a file option.</li>

                <li>A new file option allows the removal of line breaks from
                each output line. This allows other HTML tags to be used to
                separate the output lines.</li>

                <li>A "contains" rule to check for substrings has been added
                to the rules for node filtering and selective type
                changes.</li>

                <li>The right-hand view that was previously used is now
                selected automatically on startup. This can be disabled using
                the general restore window geometry option.</li>
              </ul>
            </div>

            <h4>Updates:</h4>

            <div>
              <ul>
                <li>Toolbar and tree icons are loaded from individual PNG
                files instead of from an XPM file. This improves icon
                quality.</li>

                <li>Some features from the dialogs for data types and fields
                have been moved to advanced dialogs for simplicity.</li>

                <li>Unicode characters are accepted for first-letter tree
                searches.</li>

                <li>All calls to the eval() function have been replaced for
                improved security. Thanks to Roland Meister for providing
                patches.</li>

                <li>The HTML version of the ReadMe file is now exported from
                the TreeLine version.</li>

                <li>Spaces are permitted in Linux command line
                arguments.</li>

                <li>Qt command line options are supported.</li>

                <li>There have been several minor improvements to the plugin
                module interface.</li>
              </ul>

            <div>
              <ul>
                <li>A serious problem with deleting the last child under the
                root item has been fixed.</li>

                <li>Some keyboard shortcuts for incremental searching have
                been fixed.</li>

                <li>Open nodes are restored more consistently when opening
                files.</li>

                <li>A font issue on early versions of Qt3 has been
                fixed.</li>

                <li>The search for dtd files linked from XML files has been
                disabled to eliminate errors.</li>

                <li>Visibility problems with long unbroken text lines in data
                editors have been fixed in Qt3.</li>

            <div>
              <ul>
                <li>Fixed a compatibility issue in the toolbar code that
                would prevent TreeLine from starting when PyQt was built
                against the newest versions of the sip library (versions
                4.2rc1 and 4.2rc2).</li>

                <li>Problems with editing the data of combination field types
                have been fixed.</li>

                <li>A bug in the plugin interface for setting field formats
                has been fixed.</li>

          <h3>February 4, 2005 - Release 0.11.0</h3>

          <div>
            <h4>New Features:</h4>

            <div>
              <ul>
                <li>Icons have been added to the tree view. The icon assigned
                to each data type can be changed from the Configure Data
                Types dialog box. There are several generic icons available
                within TreeLine, and plugin modules can be written to add
                additional ones. A general option to disable the tree icons
                has also been added.</li>

                <li>A command has been added to the data menu to copy type
                formatting from another TreeLine file. All types from the
                chosen file are copied. Any types in the current file with a
                matching name are overwritten, but types with unique names
                are retained.</li>

                <li>Functions to import and export generic XML files have
                been added. These routines do not have much intelligence -
                each XML element becomes a node and each XML attribute
                becomes a field. This lets TreeLine function as a crude XML
                editor.</li>

                <li>An editor height parameter has been added to text fields.
                This allows the number of lines in the data editor to be set
                for each field in each data type. As a result, the LongText
                field type becomes redundant and has been removed.</li>

                <li>A field parameter has been added for fields that are
                required to be filled. Fields with this parameter set are
                marked with an asterisk in the data editor view.</li>

                <li>Another field parameter has been added to allow certain
                fields to be hidden in the data editor view.</li>
              </ul>
            </div>

            <h4>Updates:</h4>

            <div>
              <ul>
                <li>A fair amount of TreeLine code has been rewritten to
                improve efficiency and to ease future changes. Users should
                see improved speed with large files, especially noticeable
                when repainting during editing.</li>

                <li>TreeLine now requires Python Version 2.3 or higher on
                Linux systems. The previous version of TreeLine will remain
                available for those stuck with older versions of Python.</li>

                <li>HTML tags are now stripped from node titles in the
                left-hand tree view if the fields are set to output HTML rich
                text.</li>

                <li>The plugin extension module interface has been expanded.
                Several added functions deal with node and field formatting.
                There is also a new callback trigger called whenever a node's
                data is modified.</li>

                <li>A user plugin directory can now be specified in the
                configuration file. This allows plugins to be installed
                without root/administrator access.</li>

                <li>An option has been added to the Linux installer to allow
                a different documentation directory to be specified.</li>
              </ul>
            </div>

            <div>
              <ul>
                <li>Fixed a drag-and-drop bug that wouldn't allow nodes to be
                moved instead of copied in the Linux version.</li>

                <li>Fixed the output of fields that include dashes and
                periods in their names.</li>

                <li>A problem retaining the font setting for edit views has
                been fixed.</li>

                <li>A rare startup failure due to problems with the
                encryption engine has been fixed.</li>

                <li>A rare problem with foreign language encodings has been

          <h3>October 15, 2004 - Release 0.10.0</h3>

          <div>
            <h4>New Features:</h4>

            <div>
              <ul>
                <li>One of the fields in a data type can be tagged as a
                reference field in the field-type dialog box. It defaults to
                the first field. This field is now used as the reference for
                the arrange and flatten by reference commands. It is also
                used by the new internal link feature, described below.</li>

                <li>There is a new internal link field type. It creates a
                clickable link in the Data Output window that selects the
                next node with matching text in its reference field. If link
                or reference fields contain multiple lines, each line is
                treated as a separate link or reference, respectively. If
                desired, the same field can be used as both the link and
                reference fields, so that clicking on a keyword in one node's
                field selects the next node that also has that keyword. If
                exported to HTML, the internal links function as links to
                page anchors, but, in cases with duplicate references, they
                only find the uppermost reference on the page instead of the
                next one.</li>

                <li>File encryption has been added as an option to password
                protect TreeLine files. Individual files can be set to
                encrypted mode from either "Tools-&gt;File Options" or from
                the save-as dialog. There is also a general option to set the
                default for new files. The encryption uses the SHA hash
                function as a stream cipher - it should be fairly
                secure.</li>

                <li>A default initial field value can now be specified for a
                field type. Any new nodes get this value for the given data
                field when they are created. Also, in a date or time field,
                an initial value of "Now" can be used to get a time-stamp of
                node creation.</li>

                <li>An interface to plugin extension modules has been added
                to TreeLine. This allows extensions to be written by various
                coders that provide functionality needed by a few users
                without adding bloat to the main application. Currently
                available plugins are listed on the "Downloads" page of the
                TreeLine web site. The plugins are installed by copying their
                Python file (*.py) to the plugins directory
                ("&lt;prefix&gt;/lib/treeline/plugins/" on Linux or
                "TreeLine\lib\plugins\" on Windows). A list of loaded plugins
                can be found using the "Help-&gt;About Plugins" command.
                Information about writing plugins can be found in the
                "plugininterface.py" file in the TreeLine source code.</li>

                <li>Options have been added under "Tools-&gt;General Options"
                to set the fonts used for the tree view and for the
                right-pane editor views.</li>

                <li>When printing, TreeLine will now avoid breaking pages
                between a parent and its first child. This behavior can be
                disabled by changing the "Keep first child with parent" print
                option.</li>
              </ul>
            </div>

            <h4>Updates:</h4>

            <div>
              <ul>
                <li>Unicode text handling has been improved. Unicode can now
                be used in TreeLine file names, node data type names and
                field names. Also, imported and exported text files now use
                the proper encoding based on the system's locale
                settings.</li>

                <li>A new sample TreeLine file with internal link fields has
                been added to the documentation.</li>
              </ul>
            </div>

            <h4>Bug Fixes:</h4>

            <div>
              <ul>
                <li>An occasional problem bringing up the field-type dialog
                for file-info fields was fixed.</li>

                <li>Avoid showing an oddly-named internal file-info data type
                in the dialogs after the file-info formatting is
                changed.</li>

                <li>The option to restore the view state when opening
                recently used files now works more consistently.</li>
              </ul>

            <div>
              <ul>
                <li>Unicode text is now supported without requiring
                modifications of the Python sitecustomize file. The
                sitecustomize change has been eliminated from the
                installer.</li>

                <li>The compressed ".trl.gz" extension has been added to the
                file open filter.</li>

                <li>Information about the new TreeLine mailing list has been
                added to the documentation.</li>
              </ul>

                <li>A bug that prevented XSLT file export under Linux has
                been fixed.</li>

                <li>Special characters in bookmark URL's are now properly
                escaped during export to XBEL format.</li>

          <div>
            <h4>List Information</h4>

            <p>A mailing list has been created for users to discuss anything
            and everything about TreeLine. This is the place for development
            discussions (from roadmaps to feature suggestions to beta
            testing), release announcements, bug reports, and general user
            discussions (from new uses to tips &amp; tricks to configuration
            samples).<br>
            <br>
            To subscribe, go to
            &lt;http://bellz.org/mailman/listinfo/treeline&gt;. I expect this
            to be a low-volume mailing list.</p>

          <h3>September 1, 2004 - Release 0.9.0</h3>

          <div>
            <h4>New Features:</h4>

            <div>
              <ul>
                <li>Import and export of bookmarks in both the Mozilla HTML
                format (Mozilla, Firefox and Netscape browsers) and the XBEL
                format (Konqueror, Galeon and Elinks browsers) have been
                added.</li>

                <li>An new option exports a portion of a tree to another
                TreeLine file.</li>

                <li>Command line options have been added to allow
                non-interactive file importing and exporting. This allows
                automated runs to be scheduled. For more details, run
                "treeline -h" from the command line. If using a windows
                binary, output is supressed, so it must be directed to a log
                file ("treeline -h &gt; log.txt").</li>

                <li>Options have been added to work with compressed TreeLine
                files. Individual files can be set to compressed mode from
                either "Tools-&gt;File Options" or from the save-as dialog.
                There is also a general option to set the default for new
                files. Thanks to Mathieu Girard for contributing code.</li>

                <li>A field reference to show data from any ancestor node has
                been added. The closest one with a matching field is
                used.</li>

                <li>Fields containing file meta-data have been added. These
                include file name, path, size, and modified time.</li>

                <li>Headers and footers for printing have been added. They
                can contain the file meta-data mentioned above. The headers
                and footers can also be shown in exported HTML files.</li>

                <li>HTML character formatting tags can be automatically added
                to text using a new data editor context menu. Available tags
                include bold, italics, underline, size and color. Note that
                the fields must be set to display HTML content for this to be
                effective.</li>

                <li>A new general option makes new fields default to HTML
                content. This allows for easier display of HTML formatting.
                This option is not enabled by default, since it does not
                preserve carriage returns and does not show non-escaped
                "&lt;", "&gt;" and "&amp;" symbols.</li>

                <li>When opening a recently used file, TreeLine will now
                restore the states of open and selected nodes. If desired,
                this feature can be disabled with a new general option.
                Thanks to Jan Hustak for contributing this code.</li>

                <li>The toolbar has been split into two separate bars
                (general commands and node commands) that can be shown and
                moved independently. Again, thanks to Jan Hustak for
                contributing this code.</li>

                <li>A new auto-save feature stores unsaved files with a "~"
                appended to the name. The backup files are automatically
                removed when the file is saved or TreeLine exits cleanly. The
                auto-save time interval is set in the general options.</li>

                <li>New key bindings, set to Shift+Page-Up and
                Shift+Page-Down by default, scroll the current right-hand
                child view.</li>

                <li>The XSL export command now prompts for the name of an
                optional style sheet (css). This name is stored in the
                TreeLine file as the default for future exports.</li>
              </ul>
            </div>

            <h4>Updates:</h4>

            <div>
              <ul>
                <li>There have been some general improvements to the handling
                of imported and exported files.</li>

                <li>File option settings can now be restored with undo/redo
                commands.</li>

                <li>The README documentation files have been revised to be
                more organized and readable.</li>

                <li>More sample files are provided. See the "sample_*.trl"
                files in the "doc" directory of the installation.</li>

                <li>The Linux install script now includes an option for a
                temporary build root directory.</li>
              </ul>
            </div>

                deeply nested tree.</li>

                <li>Some problems with auto-completion on data editor combo
                boxes have been fixed.</li>

                <li>Problems in windows with some option spin boxes accepting
                new values have been fixed.</li>

                <li>Fixed a compatibility issue with older versions of
                Python.</li>
              </ul>
            </div>

              </ul>
            </div>

            <div>
              <ul>
                <li>Spell checking of the tree data has been implemented.

          <h3>November 7, 2003 - Release 0.6.1</h3>

          <div>
            <h4>New Features:</h4>

            <div>
              <ul>
                <li>Incremental searching has been improved by adding
                keyboard commands to repeat the search forward (F3 by
                default) and backward (Shift-F3 by default).</li>

                <li>The sorting commands now contain options for reverse
                sorting.</li>

                <li>The importing of text files has been improved. Imports of
                plain text were added, with items for each line or each
                paragraph. A prompt for the type of text file was also
                added.</li>

                <li>A new option setting avoids going into title renaming
                mode when adding a new node. This also keeps the selection
                unchanged as nodes are added.</li>

                <li>Dragging files to the TreeLine window in order to open
                them is now supported.</li>

          <h3>September 16, 2003 - Release 0.6.0</h3>

          <div>
            <h4>New Features:</h4>

            <div>
              <ul>
                <li>The three right views are now divided into upper sections
                for the selection's data and lower sections for the data from
                the selection's children. View commands can be used to hide
                the display of children if desired.</li>

                <li>Keyboard shortcuts can be customized by editing the
                TreeLine configuration file ("~/.treeline" on Linux,
                "treeline.ini" on windows). Any configuration files from
                previous versions should be deleted when installing TreeLine
                0.6.0.</li>

                <li>A new command will quickly set a node's data type.</li>

                <li>Parent nodes will automatically open and close when found
                with the two search methods, by typing the first letter and
                with the "next sibling" keyboard command. This behavior can
                be disabled with a new general option.</li>

                <li>Typing a lowercase letter will move forward through the
                visible tree items that start with that letter. An uppercase
                letter will move backward.</li>

                <li>Tree items (including those not visible) can be
                incrementally searched by typing "/" followed by the search
                string.</li>

                <li>The Find dialog box is now modeless (the program may be
                operated while the dialog is open).</li>

                <li>A "Choice" field type has been added that allows
                selection from a user-defined list of strings.</li>

                <li>A "Combination" field type has been added that allows
                selection of several items from a user-defined list of
                strings.</li>

                <li>Several linking field types have been added, including
                "URL", "Path", "Email", and "Picture". Clicking on a "URL" or
                "Path" in the output window will open the link in an external
                browser. The "Picture" fields are shown on in the output
                window for certain image formats.</li>

                <li>Pull-down editors have been added for the "Choice",
                "Combination", "Date", "Time", and "Boolean" field
                types.</li>

                <li>A font selection for the data output view has been added
                to the general options.</li>

                <li>New printing options include setting the print font and
                setting a default page size.</li>
              </ul>

                characters in the field format's prefix and suffix
                areas.</li>
